# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you. 
   This only applies to non-maintainers. 

### Formatting your pull request

Please ensure to include any relevant information to your pull request description.

## Creating issues

This project uses issues as the primary method of tracking work that needs to be done, along
with documenting any bugs that need resolution.

When creating an issue, if it is part of a milestone (a collection of related issues), then
please select the milestone from the dropdown.

If an issue is ready to be played (that is, ready to be worked on), then add the `READY TO PLAY` 
label. Likewise if it is not ready to be played, then one should select the `BLOCKED` label.

Categorial labels should also be added at your own discretion. 

### Weights

If this is an issue marking a job to be done, and not a new ticket marking a bug, you should add 
a weight to the ticket. This is a number that gives a general idea of how much work is needed to
complete a task. Weights should use numbers from the 
[fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html)
(so one up from a 3-point task is a 5-point task, etc). 

These numbers increase non-linearly. If you are stuck on what to point something,
the following is a good starting point:

- 1. A simple task that may take less than 15 minutes to complete.
- 2. A task that may take an hour to complete fully.
- 3. A task that may take up to a few hours to complete fully.
- 5. A task that may take a day to complete fully.
- 8. A task that may take two people a day to complete together, or about one and a half days alone.
- 13. A task that may take a few days to complete.
- 21. A task that may take a week or more to complete.
- 34. A task that may take two weeks to complete.

... et cetera.

### Adding bugs in issues

If you are adding a bug, please outline the following details if possible:

- What you are trying to do when you get the issue.
- What you expect to happen.
- Any traceback and error messages.
- Your OS, Python version, Python implementation (e.g. cpython, stackless, pypi, etc)
- The version of the library you are using
- Any other relevant screenshots, observations, or anything you think might help us out :-)
