# Hikari contribution guidelines

First off, we would like to thank you for taking the time to help improve Hikari, it's greatly appreciated. We have
some contribution guidelines that you should follow to ensure that your contribution is at its best.

# Code of conduct

Hikari has a code of conduct that must be followed at all times by all the members of the project. Breaking the code
of conduct can lead to a ban from the project and a report to GitHub.

You can read the code of conduct [here](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Branches

We would like to keep consistency in naming branches.

**This should be followed to ensure no issues when specific jobs run.**
**Your merge request could be closed if a developer/maintainer thinks it is risky due to pipelines failing.**

To push branches directly to the remote, you will have to name them like this:
  - `task/issue-number-small-info-on-branch`
    - This should be the default for any commit that doesn't fall in any of the cases under.
  - `feature/issue-number-small-info-on-branch`
    - This should be used for branches that require more tasks to merge into before going as one MR into `master`.
  - `bugfix/issue-number-small-info-on-branch`
    - This should be used for bugfixes.

`issue-number` is optional (only use if issue exists) and can be left out. `small-info-on-branch` should be replaced
with a small description of the branch.

# Nox

We have nox to help out with running pipelines locally and provides some helpful functionality.

Nox is similar to tox, but uses a pure Python configuration instead of an INI based configuration. Nox and tox are
both tools for generating virtual environments and running commands in those environments. Examples of usage include
installing, configuring, and running flake8, running pytest, etc.

You can check all the available nox commands by running `nox -l`.

Before committing we recommend you to run `nox` to run all important pipelines and make sure the pipelines won't fail.

You may run a single pipeline with `nox -s name` or multiple pipelines with `nox -s name1 name3 name9`.

# Pipelines

We have several jobs to ensure that the code is at its best that in can be.

This includes:
  - `test`
    - Run tests and installation of the package on different OS's and python versions.
  - `linting`
    - Linting (`flake8`), type checking (`mypy`), and safety (`safety`).
  - `twemoji`
    - Force test all discord emojis.
  - `pages`
    - Generate webpage + documentation.

All jobs will need to succeed before anything gets merged.

Note that this rule may be skipped for `twemoji` if the problem is caused by a change Discord have made to their
mapping.
