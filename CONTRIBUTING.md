# Hikari contribution guidelines

First off, we would like to thank you for taking the time to help improve Hikari, it's greatly appreciated. We have
some contribution guidelines that you should follow to ensure that your contribution is at its best.

# Code of conduct

Hikari has a code of conduct that must be followed at all times by all the members of the project. Breaking the code
of conduct can lead to a ban from the project and a report to GitHub.

You can read the code of conduct [here](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Versioning scheme

This project follows the versioning scheme stated by [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/).

The development version number is increased automatically after each release in the `master` branch in the master
repository.

Please also refer to the [EffVer Versioning specification](https://jacobtomlinson.dev/effver/) for more information.

More specifically:

- Major bump: Big changes to the public facing API.
- Minor bump: New features or changes that require some developer interaction to upgrade to, including
  removal/renaming of features.
- Micro bump: Bug fixes and new features that require no end developer interaction (deprecations can be included here).

# Deprecation process

The removal or renaming of anything facing the public facing API must go through a deprecation process, which should
match that of the versioning scheme. There are utilities under `hikari.internal.deprecation` to aid with it.

# UV Package Manager

We use the `uv` package manager as a faster drop-in replacement for `pip`. While it's not required to use in order to
contribute to hikari, it's highly recommended! From here on we will use `uv` instead of `pip`.

Installing `uv` is explained [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

If you still want to use `pip` as your package manager, you can see the equivalent `pip` command by clicking on
the dropdowns below every command.

# Getting Started

First of all you should start by cloning the repository.
In the repository, make a virtual environment 
```bash
uv venv
```
<details>
    <summary>Equivalent pip command</summary>
    
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
</details>

and enter it:
- On Linux/macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- On Windows: one of `.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`, `.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`, or `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

Then you should continue by installing [nox](#nox).

# Nox

We have nox to help out with running pipelines locally and provides some helpful functionality.

You will need to install `nox` locally before running any pipelines.

```bash
uv sync --group nox
```
<details>
    <summary>Equivalent pip command</summary>
    
```bash
pip install 'nox[uv]'
```
</details>

Nox is similar to tox, but uses a pure Python configuration instead of an INI based configuration. Nox and tox are
both tools for generating virtual environments and running commands in those environments. Examples of usage include
installing, configuring, and running flake8, running pytest, etc.

You can check all the available nox commands by running `nox -l`.

Before committing we recommend you to run `nox` to run all important pipelines and make sure the pipelines won't fail.

You may run a single pipeline with `nox -s name` or multiple pipelines with `nox -s name1 name3 name9`.

# Pipelines

We have several jobs to ensure that the code is at its best that in can be.

This includes:

- `test`
    - Run tests and installation of the package on different OS's and python versions.
- `linting`
    - Linting (`flake8`), type checking (`mypy`), audit (`pip-audit`) and spelling (`codespell`).
- `twemoji`
    - Force test all discord emojis.
- `pages`
    - Generate webpage + documentation.

All jobs will need to succeed before anything gets merged.

# Towncrier

To aid with the generation of `CHANGELOG.md` as well as the releases changelog we use `towncrier`.

You will need to install `towncrier` and `hikari` from source before making changelog additions.

```bash
uv sync --group towncrier
```
<details>
    <summary>Equivalent pip command</summary>
    
```bash
pip install towncrier
```
</details>

For every pull request made to this project, there should be a short explanation of the change under `changes/`
with the following format: `{pull_request_number}.{type}.md`,

Possible types are:

- `feature`: Signifying a new feature.
- `bugfix`: Signifying a bugfix.
- `documentation`: Signifying a documentation improvement.
- `removal`: Signifying a deprecation or removal of public API.

For changes that do not fall under any of the above cases, please specify the lack of the changelog in the pull request
description so that a maintainer can skip the job that checks for newly added fragments.

Best way to create the fragments is to run `towncrier create {pull_request_number}.{type}.md` after creating the
pull request, edit the created file and committing the changes.

Multiple fragment types can be created per pull request if it covers multiple areas.

# Branches

We would like to keep consistency in naming branches in the remote.

To push branches directly to the remote, you will have to name them like this:

- `feature/issue-number-small-info-on-branch`
    - This should be used for branches that require more tasks to merge into before going as one MR into `master`.
- `bugfix/issue-number-small-info-on-branch`
    - This should be used for bugfixes.
- `task/issue-number-small-info-on-branch`
    - This should be the default for any commit that doesn't fall in any of the cases above.

`issue-number` is optional (only use if issue exists) and can be left out. `small-info-on-branch` should be replaced
with a small description of the branch.
