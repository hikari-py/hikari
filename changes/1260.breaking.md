Support v10 attachments edits

This includes breaking changes, features and things to look out for when editing messages:
- Modifying attachments in messages that contain embeds with any image attached to them now requires the images of that embed
  image to be re-passed in the edit or they will be lost.
- `attachment` and `attachments` in message edits now support passing an `Attachment` object to keep existing attachments.
- `replace_attachments` has been removed, as it is now the default.
  - `attachment` and `attachments` now supports `None` to replicate the behaviour of fully removing all attachments.
