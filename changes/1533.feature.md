Refactors to the component builder interfaces which make them flatter:

* `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED` can now be passed to `TextInputBuilder.set_placeholder` and `TextInputBuilder.set_value`.
* The standard implementation of a select option builder is now exposed at `hikari.impl.special_endpoints.SelectOptionBuilder`.
