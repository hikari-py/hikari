Improve components lifetimes:
- `GatewayBot`:
  - General speedups.
  - Fix a lot of edge cases of hard crashes if the application shuts unexpectedly.
  - More consistent signal handling.
  - `run`'s `shard_ids` argument can now be a `typing.Sequence`.
  - Improved logging.
- `RESTBot`:
  - Consistent signal handling inline with `GatewayBot`.
  - Improved logging.
  - Improved loop closing.
- `GatewayShardImpl`:
  - New `is_connected` property to determine whether the shard is connected to the gateway.
  - Faster websocket pulling and heartbeating.
  - Improved error handling.
  - Rate limiting changes:
    - Chunking no longer has its own special ratelimit. Now it is shared with the rest of
    "non-priority" packages sent, which is of 117/60s (3 less than the hard limit).
      - "priority" packages currently only include heartbeating.
