Several cache bugfixes
  - `CacheImpl.clear_members` and `CacheImpl.delete_member` only returning the members that have been fully deleted
    - This was contrary to all the other methods were the objects would be returned regardlesss of the internal references to it
  - `CacheImpl.clear_voice_states_for_channel` not actually deleting the voice states
