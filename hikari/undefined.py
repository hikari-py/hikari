"""Type hint to mark a type as being semantically optional.

**NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS `typing.Optional` BY DEFINITION**.

If you see a type with this marker, it may be `UNDEFINED` or the value it wraps.
For example, `UndefinedOr[float]` would mean the value could be a
`builtins.float`, or the literal `UNDEFINED` value.

On the other hand, `typing.Optional[float]` would mean the value could be
a `builtins.float`, or the literal `builtins.None` value.

The reason for using this is in some places, there is a semantic difference
between specifying something as being `builtins.None`, i.e. "no value", and
having a default to specify that the value has just not been mentioned. The
main example of this is in `edit` endpoints where the contents will only be
changed if they are explicitly mentioned in the call. Editing a message content
and setting it to `builtins.None` would be expected to clear the content,
whereas setting it to `UNDEFINED` would be expected to leave the value as it
is without changing it.

Consider `UndefinedOr[T]` semantically equivalent to `undefined` versus
`null` in JavaScript, or `Optional<T>` versus `null` in Java and C#.

If in doubt, remember:

- `UNDEFINED` means there is no value present, or that it has been left to
    the default value.
- `builtins.None` means the value is present and explicitly empty/null/void,
    where this has a deterministic documented behaviour and no differentiation
    is made between a `builtins.None` value, and one that has been omitted.
