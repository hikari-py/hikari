Metaclass that allows making a class that delegates fields, properties and methods to named delegate class instances.
This allows making one class implement another without having to subclass it, which enables features such as Member
objects to have several instances that refer to the same object while only physically storing the user once in memory.

class DelegatedMeta(type):
    """
    Defines a metaclass for classes that wish to implement one or more other classes via delegation rather than
    inheritance.

    What does this mean...exactly?

    Suppose you have your `User` object. That represents a user floating around in Discord space. Discord introduces
    a second abstraction called a `Member`. This is a specialisation of a `User` which has attributes binding it to
    a specific guild. Seems simple enough.

    Using inheritance, we would need to define our `Member` class as deriving from `User`, and add the extra attributes
    we care about. This is fine for the most part, the only problem is, lets assume we have my User cached already,
    and then we have 15 guilds I share with my bot. Right, that is 15 members that share all the same attributes
    that my User does, so I store stuff like my username and ID 16 times rather than once.

    Delegation works around this by replacing inheritance with a system where the Member simply decorates a User and
    then stores that User as a single field. Each field and method a User has is defined in Member as a property or
    function that simply calls the corresponding item in the User class. Thus, we can implement a User but only
    store it physically once. Because of how Python's GC works, it is perfectly safe to replace the User in the bot's
    state without rebuilding any Members that use it. The User will simply deallocate once all Members that refer to it
    stop existing.

    Example:
        >>> import dataclasses

        >>> @dataclasses.dataclass
        ... class Base:
        ...     a: int
        ...     b: float

        >>> class Delegate(metaclass=DelegatedMeta, deletage_to=(Base, "_base")):
        ...     __slots__ = ("_base", )
        ...
        ...     def __init__(self, base):
        ...         self._base = base

        >>> base = Base(1, 2.3)
        >>> delegate = Delegate(base)
        >>> base.b
        2.3
        >>> delegate.b
        2.3
        >>> base.b = 4.5
        >>> delegate.b
        4.5

    The delegation process is performed on class initialization, meaning once defined once, there is almost zero
    overhead other than one more function call per attribute access; memory overhead is simply one field per instance.

    Note:
        This currently supports slotted elements, delegating by inspecting type annotations, delegating properties,
        delegating methods, coroutine methods, class methods, class coroutine methods, static methods, and static
        coroutine methods.

        Only elements that do not start with an underscore will be delegated.

    Note:
        Subclassing delegate types is experimental currently. You do so at your own risk :-)

    Warning:
        You cannot currently call `isinstance` or `issubclass` on the delegate and the thing it delegates to and
        expect a valid result.
