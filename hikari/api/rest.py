        Parameters
        ----------

            The channel to fetch. This may be the object or the ID of an

        hikari.channels.PartialChannel
            The channel. This will be a _derivative_ of
            `hikari.channels.PartialChannel`, depending on the type of
            channel you request for.

            This means that you may get one of

            `hikari.channels.GuildNewsChannel`.

            Likewise, the `hikari.channels.GuildChannel` can be used to
            determine if a channel is guild-bound, and
            `hikari.channels.TextableChannel` can be used to determine
            if the channel provides textual functionality to the application.

            You can check for these using the `isinstance`
            builtin function.

        region : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[str, hikari.voices.VoiceRegion]]
            If provided, the voice region to set for this channel. Passing
            `None` here will set it to "auto" mode where the used
            region will be decided based on the first person who connects to it
            when it's empty.
        permission_overwrites : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.channels.PermissionOverwrite]]
            If provided, the new permission overwrites for the channel.

            If provided, the auto archive duration Discord's end user client
            should default to when creating threads in this channel.

            This should be either 60, 1440, 4320 or 10080 seconds and, as of
            writing, ignores the parent channel's set default_auto_archive_duration
            when passed as `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`.
        archived : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether to archive or unarchive this thread channel.
        locked : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]

        invitable : undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether non-moderators should be able to add other non-moderators to the thread.

            This only applies to private threads.
        auto_archive_duration : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.internal.time.Intervalish]
            If provided, how long the thread should remain inactive until it's archived.

            This should be either 60, 1440, 4320 or 10080 seconds and, as of
            writing, ignores the parent channel's set default_auto_archive_duration
            when passed as `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`.
        reason : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[str]
            If provided, the reason that will be recorded in the audit logs.
            Maximum of 512 characters.

            Object or Id of the channel to edit a voice state in.
        user : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.users.PartialUser]
            Object or Id of the user to to edit the voice state of.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        suppress : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If defined, whether the user should be allowed to become a speaker
            in the target stage channel.

        Raises
        ------
        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            If you try to target a non-staging channel.
        hikari.errors.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.errors.ForbiddenError
            If you are missing the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission in the channel.
        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the channel, message or voice state is not found.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.errors.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

        Parameters
        ----------
        channel : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.channels.TextableChannel]
            The channel to create the message in.
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `str`.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and no `embed` nor `embeds` kwarg
            is provided, then this will instead update the embed. This allows
            for simpler syntax when sending an embed alone.

            Likewise, if this is a `hikari.files.Resource`, then the
            content is instead treated as an attachment if no `attachment` and
            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        attachment : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.files.Resourceish]
            If provided, the message attachment. This can be a resource,
            or string of a path on your computer or a URL.

            Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
            convenience.

            - If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `str` to a valid URL, the
                resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
                sending the message. Subclasses of
                `hikari.files.WebResource` such as
                `hikari.files.URL`,
                `hikari.messages.Attachment`,
                `hikari.emojis.Emoji`,
                `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
                This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
                resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
                scalability.
            - If a `hikari.files.Bytes` is passed, or a `str`
                that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
                with a randomized file name if not provided.
            - If a `hikari.files.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
                `str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
                on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
                as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
                using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
                type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
                the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
                behaviour).
        attachments : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.files.Resourceish]]
            If provided, the message attachments. These can be resources, or
            strings consisting of paths on your computer or URLs.
        component : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to include in this message.
        components : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include
            in this message.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.embeds.Embed]]
            If provided, the message embeds.
        tts : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether the message will be read out by a screen
            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        reply : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.messages.PartialMessage]]
            If provided, the message to reply to.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        mentions_reply : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether to mention the author of the message
            that is being replied to.

            This will not do anything if not being used with `reply`.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.guilds.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.
        flags : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.messages.MessageFlag]
            If provided, optional flags to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing is changed.

            Note that some flags may not be able to be set. Currently the only
            flags that can be set are `NONE` and `SUPPRESS_EMBEDS`.

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.messages.Message
            The created message.

        ------

        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages

            Also important to note that if you specify a text `content`, `mentions_everyone`,
            `mentions_reply`, `user_mentions`, and `role_mentions` will default
            to `False` as the message will be re-parsed for mentions. This will
            also occur if only one of the four are specified

            This is a limitation of Discord's design. If in doubt, specify all
            four of them each time.

        Parameters
        ----------
        channel : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.channels.TextableChannel]
            The channel to create the message in. This may be
            the object or the ID of an existing channel.
        message : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.messages.PartialMessage]
            The message to edit. This may be the object or the ID
            of an existing message.
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message content to update with. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the content will not
            be changed. If `None`, then the content will be removed.

            Any other value will be cast to a `str` before sending.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and neither the `embed` or
            `embeds` kwargs are provided or if this is a
            `hikari.files.Resourceish` and neither the
            `attachment` or `attachments` kwargs are provided, the values will
            be overwritten. This allows for simpler syntax when sending an
            embed or an attachment alone.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        attachment : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Union[hikari.files.Resourceish, hikari.messages.Attachment]]
            If provided, the attachment to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous attachment, if
            present, is not changed. If this is `None`, then the
            attachment is removed, if present. Otherwise, the new attachment
            that was provided will be attached.
        attachments : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[typing.Union[hikari.files.Resourceish, hikari.messages.Attachment]]]
            If provided, the attachments to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous attachments, if
            present, are not changed. If this is `None`, then the
            attachments is removed, if present. Otherwise, the new attachments
            that were provided will be attached.
        component : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to set for this message.
            This component will replace any previously set components and passing
            `None` will remove all components.
        components : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing `None` or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the embed to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed(s) are not changed.
            If this is `None` then any present embeds are removed.
            Otherwise, the new embed that was provided will be used as the
            replacement.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.embeds.Embed]]
            If provided, the embeds to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed(s) are not changed.
            If this is `None` then any present embeds are removed.
            Otherwise, the new embeds that were provided will be used as the
            replacement.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, sanitation for `@everyone` mentions. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the previous setting is
            not changed. If `True`, then `@everyone`/`@here` mentions
            in the message content will show up as mentioning everyone that can
            view the chat.
        mentions_reply : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether to mention the author of the message
            that is being replied to.

            This will not do anything if `message` is not a reply message.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, sanitation for user mentions. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the previous setting is
            not changed. If `True`, all valid user mentions will behave
            as mentions. If `False`, all valid user mentions will not
            behave as mentions.

            You may alternatively pass a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake` user IDs, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser`-derived objects.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], bool]]
            If provided, sanitation for role mentions. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the previous setting is
            not changed. If `True`, all valid role mentions will behave
            as mentions. If `False`, all valid role mentions will not
            behave as mentions.

            You may alternatively pass a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake` role IDs, or
            `hikari.guilds.PartialRole`-derived objects.
        flags : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.messages.MessageFlag]
            If provided, optional flags to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing is changed.

            Note that some flags may not be able to be set. Currently the only
            flags that can be set are `NONE` and `SUPPRESS_EMBEDS`. If you
            have `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permissions, you can use this call to
            suppress embeds on another user's message.

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.messages.Message
            The edited message.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If both `attachment` and `attachments`, `component` and `components`
            or `embed` and `embeds` are specified.
        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no embeds; messages with more than 2000 characters
            in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; invalid image URLs in embeds.
        hikari.errors.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.errors.ForbiddenError
            If you are missing the `SEND_MESSAGES` in the channel; if you try to
            change the contents of another user's message; or if you try to edit
            the flags on another user's message without the `MANAGE_MESSAGES`
            permission.
        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the channel or message is not found.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.errors.InternalServerError

            If one message is left over from chunking per 100 messages, or

        .. warning::
            As of writing, `username` and `avatar_url` are ignored for
            interaction webhooks.

        Parameters
        ----------
        webhook : typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.Snowflakeish, hikari.webhooks.ExecutableWebhook]
            The webhook to execute. This may be the object
            or the ID of an existing webhook.
        token : str
            The webhook token.
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `str`.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and no `embed` nor
            no `embeds` kwarg is provided, then this will instead
            update the embed. This allows for simpler syntax when
            sending an embed alone.

            Likewise, if this is a `hikari.files.Resource`, then the
            content is instead treated as an attachment if no `attachment` and
            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        thread : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.channels.GuildThreadChannel]]
            If provided then the message will be created in the target thread
            within the webhook's channel, otherwise it will be created in
            the webhook's target channel.

            This is required when trying to create a thread message.
        username : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[str]
            If provided, the username to override the webhook's username
            for this request.
        avatar_url : typing.Union[hikari.undefined.UndefinedType, hikari.files.URL, str]
            If provided, the url of an image to override the webhook's
            avatar with for this request.
        attachment : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.files.Resourceish]
            If provided, the message attachment. This can be a resource,
            or string of a path on your computer or a URL.

            Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
            convenience.

            - If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `str` to a valid URL, the
                resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
                sending the message. Subclasses of
                `hikari.files.WebResource` such as
                `hikari.files.URL`,
                `hikari.messages.Attachment`,
                `hikari.emojis.Emoji`,
                `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
                This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
                resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
                scalability.
            - If a `hikari.files.Bytes` is passed, or a `str`
                that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
                with a randomized file name if not provided.
            - If a `hikari.files.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
                `str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
                on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
                as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
                using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
                type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
                the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
                behaviour).
        attachments : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.files.Resourceish]]
            If provided, the message attachments. These can be resources, or
            strings consisting of paths on your computer or URLs.
        component : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to include in this message.
        components : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include
            in this message.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.embeds.Embed]]
            If provided, the message embeds.
        tts : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether the message will be read out by a screen
            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.guilds.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.
        flags : typing.Union[hikari.undefined.UndefinedType, int, hikari.messages.MessageFlag]
            The flags to set for this webhook message.

            .. warning::
                As of writing this can only be set for interaction webhooks
                and the only settable flag is `EPHEMERAL`; this field is just
                ignored for non-interaction webhooks.

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.messages.Message
            The created message.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions` or if both `attachment` and
            `attachments` or `embed` and `embeds` are specified.
        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; too many components.
        hikari.errors.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the webhook is not found.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.errors.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

            The message to delete. This may be the object or the ID of
            an existing message.
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message content to update with. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the content will not
            be changed. If `None`, then the content will be removed.

            Any other value will be cast to a `str` before sending.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and neither the
            `embed` or `embeds` kwargs are provided or if this is a

            If provided then the message will be edited in the target thread
            within the webhook's channel, otherwise it will be edited in
            the webhook's target channel.

            This is required when trying to edit a thread message.
        attachment : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Union[hikari.files.Resourceish, hikari.messages.Attachment]]
            If provided, the attachment to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous attachment, if
            present, is not changed. If this is `None`, then the
            attachment is removed, if present. Otherwise, the new attachment
            that was provided will be attached.
        attachments : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[typing.Union[hikari.files.Resourceish, hikari.messages.Attachment]]]
            If provided, the attachments to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous attachments, if
            present, are not changed. If this is `None`, then the
            attachments is removed, if present. Otherwise, the new attachments
            that were provided will be attached.

            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing `None` or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the embed to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed(s) are not changed.
            If this is `None` then any present embeds are removed.
            Otherwise, the new embed that was provided will be used as the

        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.embeds.Embed]]
            If provided, the embeds to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed(s) are not changed.
            If this is `None` then any present embeds are removed.
            Otherwise, the new embeds that were provided will be used as the
            replacement.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, sanitation for `@everyone` mentions. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the previous setting is
            not changed. If `True`, then `@everyone`/`@here` mentions
            in the message content will show up as mentioning everyone that can
            view the chat.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all user mentions will be detected.

        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.
        TypeError
            If both `embed` and `embeds` are specified.
        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no embeds; messages with more than 2000 characters
            in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed limits
            invalid image URLs in embeds.
        hikari.errors.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the interaction is not found or if the interaction's initial
            response has already been created.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.errors.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

        .. note::
            Mentioning everyone, roles, or users in message edits currently

            on Discord. It will still highlight in their chat as if they
            were mentioned, however.

            Also important to note that if you specify a text `content`, `mentions_everyone`,
            `mentions_reply`, `user_mentions`, and `role_mentions` will default
            to `False` as the message will be re-parsed for mentions. This will

            This is a limitation of Discord's design. If in doubt, specify all

        Parameters
        ----------
        application : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.guilds.PartialApplication]
            Object or ID of the application to edit a command response for.
        token : str
            The interaction's token.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message content to update with. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the content will not
            be changed. If `None`, then the content will be removed.

            Any other value will be cast to a `str` before sending.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and neither the
            `embed` or `embeds` kwargs are provided or if this is a
            `hikari.files.Resourceish` and neither the `attachment` or
            `attachments` kwargs are provided, the values will be overwritten.
            This allows for simpler syntax when sending an embed or an
            attachment alone.
        attachment : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Union[hikari.files.Resourceish, hikari.messages.Attachment]]
            If provided, the attachment to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous attachment, if
            present, is not changed. If this is `None`, then the
            attachment is removed, if present. Otherwise, the new attachment
            that was provided will be attached.
        attachments : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[typing.Union[hikari.files.Resourceish, hikari.messages.Attachment]]]
            If provided, the attachments to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous attachments, if
            present, are not changed. If this is `None`, then the
            attachments is removed, if present. Otherwise, the new attachments
            that were provided will be attached.
        component : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to set for this message.
            This component will replace any previously set components and passing
            `None` will remove all components.
        components : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing `None` or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the embed to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed(s) are not changed.
            If this is `None` then any present embeds are removed.
            Otherwise, the new embed that was provided will be used as the
            replacement.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.embeds.Embed]]
            If provided, the embeds to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed(s) are not changed.
            If this is `None` then any present embeds are removed.
            Otherwise, the new embeds that were provided will be used as the
            replacement.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or

            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all role mentions will be detected.

            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.errors.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.
