        Parameters
        ----------
        channel : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.channels.PartialChannel]
            The channel to fetch. This may be the object or the ID of an
            existing channel.

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.channels.PartialChannel
            The channel. This will be a _derivative_ of
            `hikari.channels.PartialChannel`, depending on the type of
            channel you request for.

            This means that you may get one of
            `hikari.channels.DMChannel`,
            `hikari.channels.GroupDMChannel`,
            `hikari.channels.GuildTextChannel`,

            `hikari.channels.GuildStoreChannel`,
            `hikari.channels.GuildNewsChannel`.

            Likewise, the `hikari.channels.GuildChannel` can be used to
            determine if a channel is guild-bound, and
            `hikari.channels.TextChannel` can be used to determine
            if the channel provides textual functionality to the application.

            You can check for these using the `builtins.isinstance`
            builtin function.

        Raises
        ------

            If you are missing the `READ_MESSAGES` permission in the channel.
        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the channel is not found.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError

            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting

            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.errors.InternalServerError

            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        nonce : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.str]
            An arbitrary identifier to associate with the message. This

        !!! note
            Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
            convenience.

            - If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `builtins.str` to a valid URL, the
                resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
                sending the message. Subclasses of
                `hikari.files.WebResource` such as
                `hikari.files.URL`,
                `hikari.messages.Attachment`,
                `hikari.emojis.Emoji`,
                `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
                This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
                resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
                scalability.
            - If a `hikari.files.Bytes` is passed, or a `builtins.str`
                that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
                with a randomized file name if not provided.
            - If a `hikari.files.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
                `builtins.str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
                on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
                as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
                using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
                type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
                the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
                behaviour).

        -------
        hikari.messages.Message
            The created message.

        builtins.TypeError
            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are specified.
        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; users in `user_mentions` not being
            mentioned in the message content; roles in `role_mentions` not
            being mentioned in the message content.
        hikari.errors.UnauthorizedError

            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.

        Parameters

        channel : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.channels.TextChannel]
            The channel to create the message in. This may be
            the object or the ID of an existing channel.
        message : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.messages.PartialMessage]
            The message to edit. This may be the object or the ID
            of an existing message.
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message content to update with. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the content will not
            be changed. If `builtins.None`, then the content will be removed.

            Any other value will be cast to a `builtins.str` before sending.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and no `embed` kwarg is
            provided, then this will instead update the embed. This allows for
            simpler syntax when sending an embed alone.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the embed to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed if
            present is not changed. If this is `builtins.None`, then the embed
            is removed if present. Otherwise, the new embed value that was
            provided will be used as the replacement.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, sanitation for `@everyone` mentions. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the previous setting is
            not changed. If `builtins.True`, then `@everyone`/`@here` mentions
            in the message content will show up as mentioning everyone that can
            view the chat.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[typing.Collection[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.users.PartialUser]], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, sanitation for user mentions. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the previous setting is
            not changed. If `builtins.True`, all valid user mentions will behave
            as mentions. If `builtins.False`, all valid user mentions will not
            behave as mentions.

            You may alternatively pass a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake` user IDs, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser`-derived objects.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[typing.Collection[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.guilds.PartialRole]], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, sanitation for role mentions. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then the previous setting is
            not changed. If `builtins.True`, all valid role mentions will behave
            as mentions. If `builtins.False`, all valid role mentions will not
            behave as mentions.

            You may alternatively pass a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake` role IDs, or
            `hikari.guilds.PartialRole`-derived objects.
        flags : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.messages.MessageFlag]
            If provided, optional flags to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing is changed.

            Note that some flags may not be able to be set. Currently the only
            flags that can be set are `NONE` and `SUPPRESS_EMBEDS`. If you
            have `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permissions, you can use this call to
            suppress embeds on another user's message.

        !!! note
            Mentioning everyone, roles, or users in message edits currently
            will not send a push notification showing a new mention to people
            on Discord. It will still highlight in their chat as if they
            were mentioned, however.

        !!! note
            There is currently no documented way to clear attachments or edit
            attachments from a previously sent message on Discord's API. To
            do this, `delete` the message and re-send it. This also applies
            to embed attachments.

        !!! warning
            If you specify one of `mentions_everyone`, `user_mentions`, or
            `role_mentions`, then all others will default to `builtins.False`,
            even if they were enabled previously.

            This is a limitation of Discord's design. If in doubt, specify all three of
            them each time.

        !!! warning
            If the message was not sent by your user, the only parameter
            you may provide to this call is the `flags` parameter. Anything
            else will result in a `hikari.errors.ForbiddenError` being raised.

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.messages.Message
            The edited message.

            The webhook to edit. This may be the object or the
            ID of an existing webhook.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        token : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.str]
            If provided, the webhoook token that will be used to edit
            the webhook instead of the token the client was initialized with.
        name : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.str]
            If provided, the new webhook name.
        avatar : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.files.Resourceish]
            If provided, the new webhook avatar. If `builtins.None`, will
            remove the webhook avatar.
        channel : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.channels.TextChannel]]
            If provided, the text channel to move the webhook to.
        reason : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.str]
            If provided, the reason that will be recorded in the audit logs.
            Maximum of 512 characters.

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.webhooks.Webhook
            The edited webhook.

        Raises
        ------
        hikari.errors.ForbiddenError
            If you are missing the `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS` permission when not
            using a token.
        hikari.errors.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the webhook is not found.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.errors.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

        Parameters
        ----------
        webhook : hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.webhooks.Webhook]
            The webhook to execute. This may be the object
            or the ID of an existing webhook
        token: builtins.str
            The webhook token.
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `builtins.str`.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and no `embed` nor
            no `embeds` kwarg is provided, then this will instead
            update the embed. This allows for simpler syntax when
            sending an embed alone.

            Likewise, if this is a `hikari.files.Resource`, then the
            content is instead treated as an attachment if no `attachment` and
            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embeds.
        attachment : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.files.Resourceish],
            If provided, the message attachment. This can be a resource,
            or string of a path on your computer or a URL.
        attachments : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.files.Resourceish]],
            If provided, the message attachments. These can be resources, or
            strings consisting of paths on your computer or URLs.
        tts : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether the message will be read out by a screen
            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        nonce : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.str]
            An arbitrary identifier to associate with the message. This
            can be used to identify it later in received events. If provided,
            this must be less than 32 bytes. If not provided, then
            a null value is placed on the message instead. All users can
            see this value.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[typing.Collection[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.users.PartialUser]], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[typing.Collection[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.guilds.PartialRole]], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.guilds.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.

        !!! note
            Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
            convenience.

            - If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `builtins.str` to a valid URL, the
                resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
                sending the message. Subclasses of
                `hikari.files.WebResource` such as
                `hikari.files.URL`,
                `hikari.messages.Attachment`,
                `hikari.emojis.Emoji`,
                `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
                This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
                resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
                scalability.
            - If a `hikari.files.Bytes` is passed, or a `builtins.str`
                that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
                with a randomized file name if not provided.
            - If a `hikari.files.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
                `builtins.str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
                on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
                as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
                using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
                type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
                the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
                behaviour).

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.messages.Message
            The created message.

        Raises
        ------
        builtins.ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.
        builtins.TypeError
            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are specified or if both
            `embed` and `embeds` are specified.
        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; users in `user_mentions` not being
            mentioned in the message content; roles in `role_mentions` not
            being mentioned in the message content.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        days : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.int]
            If provided, number of days to count prune for.
        compute_prune_count: hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether to return the prune count. This is discouraged
            for large guilds.
        include_roles : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Collection[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.guilds.PartialRole]]]
            If provided, the role(s) to include. By default, this endpoint will
            not count users with roles. Providing roles using this attribute
            will make members with the specified roles also get included into

        reason : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.str]
            If provided, the reason that will be recorded in the audit logs.
            Maximum of 512 characters.

        Returns
        -------
        typing.Optional[builtins.int]
            If `compute_prune_count` is not provided or `builtins.True`, the
            number of members pruned. Else `builtins.None`.
