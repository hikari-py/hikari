    This will be used by the gateway and REST API to cache specific types of
    objects that the application should attempt to remember for later, depending
    on how this is implemented. The requirement for this stems from the
    assumption by Discord that bot applications will maintain some form of
    "memory" of the events that occur.

    The implementation may choose to use a simple in-memory collection of
    objects, or may decide to use a distributed system such as a Redis cache
    for cross-process bots.
