    Unlike `hikari.iterators.LazyIterator` (which this extends), an event

    Examples
    --------
    A streamer may either be started and closed using `with` syntax
    where `EventStream.open` and `EventStream.close` are implicitly called based on
    context.

    ```py
    with EventStream(app, EventType, timeout=50) as stream:
        async for entry in stream:
            ...
    ```

    A streamer may also be directly started and closed using the `EventStream.close`
    and `EventStream.open`. Note that if you don't call `EventStream.close` after
    opening a streamer when you're finished with it then it may queue events
    events in memory indefinitely.

    ```py
    stream = EventStream(app, EventType, timeout=50)
    await stream.open()

        ...

        We can dispatch custom events by first defining a class that

        import attr

        from hikari.traits import RESTAware

        from hikari.users import User

            app: RESTAware = attr.field()

            author: User = attr.field()
            '''The user who mentioned everyone.'''

            content: str = attr.field()
            '''The message that was sent.'''

            message_id: Snowflake = attr.field()
            '''The message ID.'''

            channel_id: Snowflake = attr.field()
            '''The channel ID.'''
        ```

        We can then dispatch our event as we see fit.

        ```py
        from hikari.events.messages import MessageCreateEvent

        @bot.listen(MessageCreateEvent)
        async def on_message(event):
            if "@everyone" in event.content or "@here" in event.content:

                )

                bot.dispatch(event)
        ```

        This event can be listened to elsewhere by subscribing to it with
        `EventManager.subscribe`.

        ```py
        @bot.listen(EveryoneMentionedEvent)
        async def on_everyone_mentioned(event):
            print(event.user, "just pinged everyone in", event.channel_id)
