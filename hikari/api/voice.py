    Since voice will generally be run in a subprocess to prevent interfering

    implementation of this is expected to implement the appropriate mechanisms
    for communicating with a voice subprocess and controlling it, however, this
    is left to the discretion of each implementation.

    Control is left to the implementation to define how to perform it. The
    idea is to allow various decoders to be implemented to allow this to direct
    interface with other types of system outside this library, such as LavaLink,
    for example.

    Implementations may wish to provide a second mechanism to allow the voice
    implementation to communicate with the bot itself, if desired, but this
