    Since voice will generally be run in a subprocess to prevent interfering

    for communicating with a voice subprocess and controlling it, however, this
    is left to the discretion of each implementation.

    Control is left to the implementation to define how to perform it. The
    idea is to allow various decoders to be implemented to allow this to direct
