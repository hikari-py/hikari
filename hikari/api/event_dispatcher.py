        """Dispatch an event.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event : hikari.events.base.HikariEvent
            The event to dispatch.

        Example
        -------
        We can dispatch custom events by first defining a class that
        derives from `hikari.events.base.HikariEvent`.

        ```py
        import attr

        from hikari.events.base import HikariEvent
        from hikari.models.users import User
        from hikari.utilities.snowflake import Snowflake

        @attr.s(auto_attribs=True)
        class EveryoneMentionedEvent(HikariEvent):
            author: User
            '''The user who mentioned everyone.'''

            content: str
            '''The message that was sent.'''

            message_id: Snowflake
            '''The message ID.'''

            channel_id: Snowflake
            '''The channel ID.'''
        ```

        We can then dispatch our event as we see fit.

        ```py
        from hikari.events.messages import MessageCreateEvent

        @bot.listen(MessageCreateEvent)
        async def on_message(event):
            if "@everyone" in event.content or "@here" in event.content:
                event = EveryoneMentionedEvent(
                    author=event.author,
                    content=event.content,
                    message_id=event.id,
                    channel_id=event.channel_id,
                )

                bot.dispatch(event)
        ```

        This event can be listened to elsewhere by subscribing to it with
        `IEventDispatcher.subscribe`.

        ```py
        @bot.listen(EveryoneMentionedEvent)
        async def on_everyone_mentioned(event):
            print(event.user, "just pinged everyone in", event.channel_id)
        ```

        Returns
        -------
        asyncio.Future
            A future that can be optionally awaited. If awaited, the future
            will complete once all corresponding event listeners have been
            invoked. If not awaited, this will schedule the dispatch of the
            events in the background for later.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event_type : typing.Type[hikari.events.base.HikariEvent]
            The event type to listen for. This will also listen for any
            subclasses of the given type.
        callback
            Either a function or a coroutine function to invoke. This should
            consume an instance of the given event, or an instance of a valid
            subclass if one exists. Any result is discarded.

        Example
        -------

        events.

        event_type : hikari.utilities.undefined.Undefined or typing.Type[hikari.events.base.HikariEvent]
            The event type to subscribe to. The implementation may allow this
            to be undefined. If this is the case, the event type will be inferred
            instead from the type hints on the function signature.

        typing.Callable[[Callback], Callback]
            A decorator for a function or coroutine function that passes it

        predicate
            A function or coroutine taking the event as the single parameter.
            This should return `True` if the event is one you want to return,
            or `False` if the event should not be returned.
        timeout : float or int or None
            The amount of time to wait before raising an `asyncio.TimeoutError`
            and giving up instead. This is measured in seconds. If `None`, then
            no timeout will be waited for (no timeout can result in "leaking" of
            coroutines that never complete if called in an uncontrolled way,
            so is not recommended).

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.events.base.HikariEvent
            The event that was provided.

        Raises
        ------
        asyncio.TimeoutError
            If the timeout is not `None` and is reached before an event is
            received that the predicate returns `True` for.
