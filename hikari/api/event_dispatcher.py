        Parameters
        ----------
        event : hikari.events.base.Event
            The event to dispatch.

        Example
        -------
        We can dispatch custom events by first defining a class that
        derives from `hikari.events.base.Event`.

        ```py
        import attr

        from hikari.events.base import Event
        from hikari.models.users import User
        from hikari.utilities.snowflake import Snowflake

        @attr.s(auto_attribs=True)
        class EveryoneMentionedEvent(Event):
            author: User
            '''The user who mentioned everyone.'''

            content: str
            '''The message that was sent.'''

            message_id: Snowflake
            '''The message ID.'''

            channel_id: Snowflake
            '''The channel ID.'''
        ```

        We can then dispatch our event as we see fit.

        ```py
        from hikari.events.messages import MessageCreateEvent

        @bot.listen(MessageCreateEvent)
        async def on_message(event):
            if "@everyone" in event.content or "@here" in event.content:
                event = EveryoneMentionedEvent(
                    author=event.author,
                    content=event.content,
                    message_id=event.id,
                    channel_id=event.channel_id,
                )

                bot.dispatch(event)
        ```

        This event can be listened to elsewhere by subscribing to it with
        `IEventDispatcherBase.subscribe`.

        ```py
        @bot.listen(EveryoneMentionedEvent)
        async def on_everyone_mentioned(event):
            print(event.user, "just pinged everyone in", event.channel_id)

            will complete once all corresponding event listeners have been
            invoked. If not awaited, this will schedule the dispatch of the
            events in the background for later.
