    All types of Hikari-based application should derive from this type in order

    that make reference to it.

    Following this pattern allows you to extend this library in pretty much
    any direction you can think of without having to rewrite major piece of
    this code base.

    Example
    -------
    A quick and dirty theoretical concrete implementation may look like the
    following.

    ```py
    class MyApp(IApp):
        def __init__(self):
            self._logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
            self._cache = MyCacheImplementation(self)
