    An abstract interface for an event handler.

    The purpose of this is to provide a single unified interface that any type and shape of event
    handler can implement and automatically be compatible with the rest of Hikari's infrastructure.

    This library provides a :class:`DispatchingEventAdapter` subinterface that is implemented to
    provide capability for single-process bots, but one may choose to extend this in a different
    way to store event payloads on a message queue such as RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, IBM MQ, etc. This
    would allow a distributed bot to be designed to the user's specific use case, and allows Hikari
    to become much more expandable and flexible for large bots in the future.

        This is invoked by a gateway client instance whenever an event of any type occurs. These are
        defined in :mod:`hikari.events` for convenience and documentation purposes.

        This is a standard method that is expected to handle the given event information in some way.
        How it does this depends on what the implementation is expected to do, but a general pattern
        that will be followed will be to invoke another method elsewhere or schedule an awaitable
        on the running event loop.
