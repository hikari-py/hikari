        Reads the contents of the file safely.

        Due to how Python implements :mod:`asyncio`, performing IO-based tasks such as reading/writing from/to
        secondary storage will block the event loop. While this happens, your bot loses the ability to
        multitask at all and will appear to have frozen.

        A module called :mod:`aiofiles` is used to mitigate this issue by running the read task in a thread pool or
        process pool. It will then await the buffers in those pools to be filled and release the event loop to the
        rest of the application while it waits for this.

        All file operations will need to be `await`ed, but apart from this, usage is mostly the same as with the
        standard :func:`builtins.open` builtin routine. The differences are that the `closefd` and `file` arguments
        are ommitted, and you can optionally pass an :class:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop` `loop` if you want to run
        this on a different loop. You can also optionally pass an :class:`concurrent.futures.Executor` if you don't
        want the operation to run on the default executor as per :meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.run_in_executor`.

        Example:

            >>> # Reading a file in text mode, one line at a time.
            >>> file = File("banner.txt")
            >>>
            >>> async with file.open() as afp:
            ...     async for line in afp:
            ...         # Technically this can block too, but just ignore that for the sake of this example.
            ...         print(line)

            >>> # Reading an entire file at once, reading it in binary mode.
            >>> file = File("cat.png")
            >>>
            >>> async with file.open("b") as afp:
            ...     data = await afp.read()

            >>> # Taking an MD5 hash of the PC's hostname
            >>> # and then using a custom thread pool to write it to a file.
            >>> import platform, concurrent.futures, hashlib
            >>>
            >>> hostname = platform.uname()[1]
            >>> md5_hash = hashlib.md5().digest()
            >>> tpe = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()
            >>>
            >>> file = File("important-stuff.sh")
            >>>
            >>> async with file.open("wb", executor=tpe, loop=loop) as afp:
