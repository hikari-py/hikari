Guild permissions.

Note:
    All the permissions defined in the :class:`Permissions` class are also
    exported into this module namespace. This means you can omit the `Permission`
    part when referring to permissions:

        >>> from hikari.orm.models import permissions
        >>> MODERATOR = permissions.MANAGE_GUILD | permissions.MANAGE_CHANNELS

"""
from __future__ import annotations

import enum
import typing


class Permission(enum.IntFlag):
    """
    Represents the permissions available in a given channel or guild.
    
    This is an int-flag enum. This means that you can **combine multiple 
    permissions together** into one value using the bitwise-OR "`|`" operator.
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        my_perms = Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD
        
        your_perms = (
            Permission.CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE
            | Permission.KICK_MEMBERS
            | Permission.BAN_MEMBERS
            | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD
        )
    
    You can **check if a permission is present** in a set of combined 
    permissions by using the bitwise-AND "`&`" operator. This will return
    the int-value of the permission if it is present, or `0` if not present.
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        my_perms = Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD
        
        if my_perms & Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS:
            if my_perms & Permission.MANAGE_GUILD:
                print("I have the permission to both manage the guild and the channels in it!")
            else:
                print("I have the permission to manage channels!")
        else:
            print("I don't have the permission to manage channels!")
            
        # Or you could simplify it:
        
        if my_perms & (Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD):
            print("I have the permission to both manage the guild and the channels in it!")
        elif my_perms & Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS:
            print("I have the permission to manage channels!")
        else:
            print("I don't have the permission to manage channels!")
        
    If you need to **check that a permission is not present**, you can use the
    bitwise-XOR "`^`" operator to check. If the permission is not present, it 
    will return a non-zero value, otherwise if it is present, it will return 0.
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        my_perms = Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD
        
        if my_perms ^ Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS:
            print("Please give me the MANAGE_CHANNELS permission!")
    
    Lastly, if you need all the permissions set except the permission you want,
    you can use the inversion operator "`~`" to do that.
    
    .. code-block:: python
