The Hikari Object Relational Model.

This provides an object-oriented interface to the Discord API, and provides features
such as the ability to cache certain objects and details that the API provides us, as
well as providing an expandable and extendable interface to wrap them together in.

The ORM is separated into several domains of components. This is done to allow
you to easily write new components if this library does not fit your use case.
