Single-threaded asyncio V6 Gateway implementation. Handles regular heartbeating in a background task
on the same event loop. Implements zlib transport compression only.

Can be used as the main gateway connection for a single-sharded bot, or the gateway connection for a
specific shard in a swarm of shards making up a larger bot.

class GatewayClient:
    """
    Implementation of a client for the Discord Gateway. This is a websocket connection to Discord that
    is used to inform your application of events that occur, and to allow you to change your presence,
    amongst other real-time applications.

    Each :class:`GatewayClient` represents a single shard.

    Expected events that may be passed to the event dispatcher are documented in the
    `gateway event reference <https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#commands-and-events>`_.
    No normalization of the gateway event names occurs, and no transformation of . In addition to this,
    a few internal events can also be triggered to notify you of changes to the connection state.
    * `CONNECT` - fired on initial connection to Discord.
    * `RECONNECT` - fired if we have previously been connected to Discord but are making a new
        connection on an existing :class:`GatewayClient` instance.
    * `DISCONNECT` - fired when the connection is closed for any reason.

    Args:
        compression:
            If True, then payload compression is enabled on the connection. If False, no payloads
            are compressed. You usually want to keep this enabled.
        connector:
            The :class:`aiohttp.BaseConnector` to use for the HTTP session that gets upgraded to a
            websocket connection. You can use this to customise connection pooling, etc.
        debug:
            If True, the client is configured to provide extra contextual information to use when
            debugging this library or extending it. This includes logging every payload that is
            sent or received to the logger as debug entries. Generally it is best to keep this
            disabled.
        dispatch:
            The method to invoke with any dispatched events. This must not be a coroutine function, 
            and must take three arguments only. The first is the reference to this 
            :class:`GatewayClient` The second is the event name.
        initial_presence:
            A raw JSON object as a :class:`dict` that should be set as the initial presence of the
            bot user once online. If or `None`, then it will be set to the default, which is
            showing up as online without a custom status message.
        intents:
            Bitfield of intents to use. If you use the V7 API, this is mandatory. This field will
            determine what events you will receive.
        json_deserialize:
            A custom JSON deserializer function to use. Defaults to :func:`json.loads`.
        json_serialize:
            A custom JSON serializer function to use. Defaults to :func:`json.dumps`.
        large_threshold:
            The number of members that have to be in a guild for it to be considered to be "large".
            Large guilds will not have member information sent automatically, and must manually
            request that member chunks be sent using :meth:`request_member_chunks`.
        proxy_auth:
            Optional :class:`aiohttp.BasicAuth` object that can be provided to allow authenticating
            with a proxy if you use one. Leave or `None` to ignore.
        proxy_headers:
            Optional :class:`aiohttp.typedefs.LooseHeaders` to provide as headers to allow the 
            connection through a proxy if you use one. Leave or `None` to ignore.
        proxy_url:
            Optional :class:`str` to use for a proxy server. If or `None`, then it is ignored.
        session_id:
            The session ID to use. If specified along with a `seq`, then the gateway client
            will attempt to RESUME an existing session rather than re-IDENTIFY. Otherwise, it
            will be ignored.
        seq:
            The sequence number to use. If specified along with a `session_id`, then the gateway
            client will attempt to RESUME an existing session rather than re-IDENTIFY. Otherwise,
            it will be ignored.
        shard_id:
            The shard ID of this gateway client. Defaults to 0.
        shard_count:
            The number of shards on this gateway. Defaults to 1, which implies no sharding is
            taking place.
        ssl_context:
            An optional custom :class:`ssl.SSLContext` to provide to customise how SSL works.
        token:
            The mandatory bot token for the bot account to use, minus the "Bot" authentication
            prefix used elsewhere.
        url:
            The websocket URL to use.
        verify_ssl:
            If True, SSL verification is enabled, which is generally what you want. If you get
            SSL issues, you can try turning this off at your own risk.
        version:
            The version of the gateway API to use. Defaults to the most recent stable documented
            version.
