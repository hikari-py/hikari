Single-threaded asyncio V7 Gateway implementation. Handles regular heartbeating in a background task
on the same event loop. Implements zlib transport compression only.

Can be used as the main gateway connection for a single-sharded bot, or the gateway connection for a specific shard
in a swarm of shards making up a larger bot.

    Implementation of the gateway communication layer. This is single threaded and can represent the connection for
    an un-sharded bot, or for a specific gateway shard. This does not implement voice activity.

    Args:
        connector:
            the method used to create a websockets connection. You usually don't want to change this.
        dispatch:
            A coroutine function that consumes a string event name and a JSON dispatch event payload consumed
            from the gateway to call each time a dispatch occurs. This payload will be a dict as described on the
            Gateway documentation. If it is not a coroutine function, it will get cast to a coroutine function first.
        host:
            the host to connect to, in the format `wss://gateway.net` or `wss://gateway.net:port` without a query
            fragment.
        initial_presence:
            A JSON-serializable dict containing the initial presence to set, or `None` to just appear
            `online`. See https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#update-status for a description
            of this `update-status` payload object.
        large_threshold:
            the large threshold limit. Defaults to 50.
        loop:
            the event loop to run on. Required.
        max_persistent_buffer_size:
            Max size to allow the zlib buffer to grow to before recreating it. This defaults to
            3MiB. A larger value favours a slight (most likely unnoticeable) overall performance increase, at the cost
            of memory usage, since the gateway can send payloads tens of megabytes in size potentially. Without
            truncating, the payload will remain at the largest allocated size even when no longer required to provide
            that capacity.
        shard_count:
            the shard count to use, or `None` if sharding is to be disabled (default).
        shard_id:
            the shard ID to use, or `None` if sharding is to be disabled (default).
        token:
            the token to use to authenticate with the gateway.

    Warning:
        It is highly recommended to not alter any attributes of this object whilst the gateway is running unless clearly
        specified otherwise. Any change to internal state may result in undefined behaviour or effects. This is designed
        to be a low-level interface to the gateway, and not a general-use object.
