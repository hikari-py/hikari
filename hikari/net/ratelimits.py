"""Complex rate limiting mechanisms.

Provides an implementation for the complex rate limiting mechanisms that Discord
requires for rate limit handling that conforms to the passed bucket headers
correctly.

What is the theory behind this implementation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this module, we refer to a :obj:`hikari.net.routes.CompiledRoute` as a
definition of a route with specific major parameter values included (e.g.
``POST /channels/123/messages``), and a :obj:`hikari.net.routes.RouteTemplate`
as a definition of a route without specific parameter values included (e.g.
``POST /channels/{channel_id}/messages``). We can compile a
:obj:`hikari.net.routes.CompiledRoute` from a
:obj:`hikari.net.routes.RouteTemplate` by providing the corresponding
parameters as kwargs, as you may already know.

In this module, a "bucket" is an internal data structure that tracks and
enforces the  rate limit state for a specific
:obj:`hikari.net.routes.CompiledRoute`,  and can manage delaying tasks in the
event that we begin to get rate limited. It also supports providing in-order
execution of queued tasks.

Discord allocates types of buckets to routes. If you are making a request and
there is a valid rate limit on the route you hit, you should receive an
``X-RateLimit-Bucket`` header from the server in your response. This is a hash
that identifies a route based on internal criteria that does not include major
parameters. This ``X-RateLimitBucket`` is known in this module as an
"bucket hash".

This means that generally, the route `POST /channels/123/messages` and
``POST /channels/456/messages`` will usually sit in the same bucket, but
``GET /channels/123/messages/789`` and ``PATCH /channels/123/messages/789`` will
usually not share the same bucket. Discord may or may not change this at any
time, so hard coding this logic is not a useful thing to be doing.

Rate limits, on the other hand, apply to a bucket and are specific to the major
parameters of the compiled route. This means that ``POST /channels/123/messages``
and ``POST /channels/456/messages`` do not share the same real bucket, despite
Discord providing the same bucket hash. A real bucket hash is the :obj:`str`
hash of the bucket that Discord sends us in a response concatenated to the
corresponding major parameters. This is used for quick bucket indexing
internally in this module.

One issue that occurs from this is that we cannot effectively hash a
:obj:`hikari.net.routes.CompiledRoute` that has not yet been hit, meaning that
until we receive a response from this endpoint, we have no idea what our rate
limits could be, nor the bucket that they sit in. This is usually not
problematic, as the first request to an endpoint should never be rate limited
unless you are hitting it from elsewhere in the same time window outside your
Hikari application. To manage this situation, unknown endpoints are allocated to
a special unlimited bucket until they have an initial bucket hash code allocated
from a response. Once this happens, the route is reallocated a dedicated bucket.
Unknown buckets have a hardcoded initial hash code internally.

Initially acquiring time on a bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each time you ``BaseRateLimiter.acquire()`` a request
timeslice for a given :obj:`hikari.net.routes.CompiledRoute`, several
things happen. The first is that we attempt to find the existing bucket for
that route, if there is one, or get an unknown bucket otherwise. This is done
by creating a real bucket hash` from the compiled route. The initial hash
is calculated using a lookup table that maps :obj:`hikari.net.routes.CompiledRoute`
objects to their corresponding initial hash codes, or to the unknown bucket
hash code if not yet known. This initial hash is processed by the
:obj:`hikari.net.routes.CompiledRoute` to provide the real bucket hash we
need to get the route's bucket object internally.

The ``acquire`` method will take the bucket and acquire a new timeslice on
it. This takes the form of a :obj:`asyncio.Future` which should be awaited by
the caller and will complete once the caller is allowed to make a request. Most
of the time, this is done instantly, but if the bucket has an active rate limit
preventing requests being sent, then the future will be paused until the rate
limit is over. This may be longer than the rate limit period if you have queued
a large number of requests during this limit, as it is first-come-first-served.

Acquiring a rate limited bucket will start a bucket-wide task (if not already
running) that will wait until the rate limit has completed before allowing more
futures to complete. This is done while observing the rate limits again, so can
easily begin to re-ratelimit itself if needed. Once the task is complete, it
tidies itself up and disposes of itself. This task will complete once the queue
becomes empty.

The result of ``RateLimiter.acquire()`` is a tuple of a
:obj:`asyncio.Future` to await on which completes when you are allowed to
proceed with making a request, and a real bucket hash which should be
stored temporarily. This will be explained in the next section.

When you make your response, you should be sure to set the
``X-RateLimit-Precision`` header to ``millisecond`` to ensure a much greater
accuracy against rounding errors for rate limits (reduces the error margin from
``1`` second to ``1`` millisecond).

Handling the rate limit headers of a response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have received your response, you are expected to extract the values of
the vital rate limit headers manually and parse them to the correct data types.
These headers are:

* ``Date``:
    the response date on the server. This should be parsed to a
    :obj:`datetime.datetime` using :func:`email.utils.parsedate_to_datetime`.
* ``X-RateLimit-Limit``:
    an :obj:`int` describing the max requests in the bucket
    from empty to being rate limited.
* ``X-RateLimit-Remaining``:
    an :obj:`int` describing the remaining number of
    requests before rate limiting occurs in the current window.
* ``X-RateLimit-Bucket``:
    a :obj:`str` containing the initial bucket hash.
* ``X-RateLimit-Reset``:
    a :obj:`float` containing the number of seconds since
    1st January 1970 at 0:00:00 UTC at which the current ratelimit window
    resets. This should be parsed to a :obj:`datetime.datetime` using
    :meth:`datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp`, passing :obj:`datetime.timezone.utc`
    as ``tz``.

Each of the above values should be passed to the
``update_rate_limits`` method to ensure that the bucket you acquired time
from is correctly updated should Discord decide to alter their ratelimits on the
fly without warning (including timings and the bucket).

This method will manage creating new buckets as needed and resetting vital
information in each bucket you use.

Tidying up
~~~~~~~~~~

To prevent unused buckets cluttering up memory, each :obj:`BaseRateLimiter`
instance spins up a :obj:`asyncio.Task` that periodically locks the bucket
list (not threadsafe, only using the concept of asyncio not yielding in regular
functions) and disposes of any clearly stale buckets that are no longer needed.
These will be recreated again in the future if they are needed.

When shutting down an application, one must remember to ``close()`` the
:obj:`BaseRateLimiter` that has been used. This will ensure the garbage collection
task is stopped, and will also ensure any remaining futures in any bucket queues
have an :obj:`asyncio.CancelledError` set on them to prevent deadlocking
ratelimited calls that may be waiting to be unlocked.
