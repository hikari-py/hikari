            This includes if the REST interaction server has already responded

        Parameters
        ----------
        response_type : typing.Union[builtins.int, CommandResponseTypesT]
            The type of interaction response this is.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `builtins.str`.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and no `embed` nor `embeds` kwarg
            is provided, then this will instead update the embed. This allows
            for simpler syntax when sending an embed alone.
        component : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to include in this message.
        components : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include
            in this message.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.embeds.Embed]]
            If provided, the message embeds.
        flags : typing.Union[builtins.int, hikari.messages.MessageFlag, hikari.undefined.UndefinedType]
            If provided, the message flags this response should have.

            As of writing the only message flag which can be set here is
            `hikari.messages.MessageFlag.EPHEMERAL`.
        tts : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether the message will be read out by a screen
            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.guilds.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.

        Raises
        ------
        builtins.ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.
        builtins.TypeError
            If both `embed` and `embeds` are specified.
        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; invalid image URLs in embeds.
        hikari.errors.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the interaction is not found or if the interaction's initial
            response has already been created.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a

            This allows for simpler syntax when sending an embed or an
            attachment alone.

            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.
        attachment : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.files.Resourceish]
            If provided, the attachment to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous attachment, if
            present, is not changed. If this is `builtins.None`, then the
            attachment is removed, if present. Otherwise, the new attachment
            that was provided will be attached.
        attachments : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.files.Resourceish]]
            If provided, the attachments to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous attachments, if
            present, are not changed. If this is `builtins.None`, then the
            attachments is removed, if present. Otherwise, the new attachments
            that were provided will be attached.
        component : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to set for this message.
            This component will replace any previously set components and passing
            `builtins.None` will remove all components.
        components : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.api.special_endpoints.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing `builtins.None` or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the embed to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed(s) are not changed.
            If this is `builtins.None` then any present embeds are removed.
            Otherwise, the new embed that was provided will be used as the
            replacement.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Sequence[hikari.embeds.Embed]]
            If provided, the embeds to set on the message. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, the previous embed(s) are not changed.
            If this is `builtins.None` then any present embeds are removed.
            Otherwise, the new embeds that were provided will be used as the
            replacement.
        replace_attachments: bool
            Whether to replace the attachments with the provided ones. Defaults
            to `builtins.False`.

            Note this will also overwrite the embed attachments.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.guilds.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.

        !!! note
            Mentioning everyone, roles, or users in message edits currently
            will not send a push notification showing a new mention to people
            on Discord. It will still highlight in their chat as if they
            were mentioned, however.

        !!! warning
            If you specify one of `mentions_everyone`, `user_mentions`, or
            `role_mentions`, then all others will default to `builtins.False`,
            even if they were enabled previously.

            This is a limitation of Discord's design. If in doubt, specify all three of
            them each time.

        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the interaction or the message are not found.

            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
