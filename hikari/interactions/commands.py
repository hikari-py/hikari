        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `builtins.str`.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and no `embed` nor
            no `embeds` kwarg is provided, then this will instead
            update the embed. This allows for simpler syntax when
            sending an embed alone.

            Likewise, if this is a `hikari.files.Resource`, then the
            content is instead treated as an attachment if no `attachment` and
            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embeds.
        flags : typing.Union[builtins.int, hikari.messages.MessageFlag, hikari.undefined.UndefinedType]
            If provided, the message flags this response should have.

            As of writing the only message flag which can be set here is
            `hikari.messages.MessageFlag.EPHEMERAL`.
        tts : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether the message will be read out by a screen
            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        nonce : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.str]
            An arbitrary identifier to associate with the message. This
            can be used to identify it later in received events. If provided,
            this must be less than 32 bytes. If not provided, then
            a null value is placed on the message instead. All users can
            see this value.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or

        Raises
        ------
        builtins.ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.
        builtins.TypeError
            If both `embed` and `embeds` are specified.
        hikari.errors.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; users in `user_mentions` not being
            mentioned in the message content; roles in `role_mentions` not
            being mentioned in the message content.
        hikari.errors.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.errors.NotFoundError
            If the interaction is not found or if the interaction's initial
            response has already been created.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.errors.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.errors.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        content : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `builtins.str`.

            If this is a `hikari.embeds.Embed` and no `embed` nor
            no `embeds` kwarg is provided, then this will instead
            update the embed. This allows for simpler syntax when
            sending an embed alone.

            Likewise, if this is a `hikari.files.Resource`, then the
            content is instead treated as an attachment if no `attachment` and
            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.
        embed : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds : hikari.undefined.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.embeds.Embed]
            If provided, the message embeds.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[builtins.bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.users.PartialUser], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.users.PartialUser` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.guilds.PartialRole], builtins.bool]]
            If provided, and `builtins.True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `builtins.False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake`, or

            specific roles.

        !!! note
            Mentioning everyone, roles, or users in message edits currently
            will not send a push notification showing a new mention to people
            on Discord. It will still highlight in their chat as if they
            were mentioned, however.

        !!! note
            There is currently no documented way to clear attachments or edit
            attachments from a previously sent message on Discord's API. To
            do this, delete the message and re-send it. This also applies
            to embed attachments.

        !!! warning
            If you specify one of `mentions_everyone`, `user_mentions`, or
            `role_mentions`, then all others will default to `builtins.False`,
            even if they were enabled previously.

            This is a limitation of Discord's design. If in doubt, specify all three of
            them each time.
