        shard_count : typing.Optional[builtins.int]
            The number of shards to use in the entire distributed application.

            determined dynamically on startup.
        status : hikari.presences.Status
            The initial status to show for the user presence on startup.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        activity : typing.Optional[hikari.presences.Activity]
            The initial activity to display in the bot user presence, or
            `builtins.None` (default) to not show any.
        afk : builtins.bool
            The initial AFK state to display in the bot user presence, or
            `builtins.False` (default) to not show any.
        idle_since : typing.Optional[datetime.datetime]
            The `datetime.datetime` the user should be marked as being idle
            since, or `builtins.None` (default) to not show this.
        ignore_session_start_limit : builtins.bool
            Defaults to `builtins.False`. If `builtins.False`, then attempting
            to start more sessions than you are allowed in a 24 hour window
            will throw a `hikari.errors.GatewayError` rather than going ahead
            and hitting the IDENTIFY limit, which may result in your token
            being reset. Setting to `builtins.True` disables this behavior.
        large_threshold : builtins.int
            Threshold for members in a guild before it is treated as being
            "large" and no longer sending member details in the `GUILD CREATE`
            event. Defaults to `250`.
        shard_ids : typing.Optional[typing.AbstractSet[builtins.int]]
            The shard IDs to create shards for. If not `builtins.None`, then
            a non-`None` `shard_count` must ALSO be provided. Defaults to
            `builtins.None`, which means the Discord-recommended count is used
            for your application instead.
        shard_count : typing.Optional[builtins.int]
            The number of shards to use in the entire distributed application.
            Defaults to `builtins.None` which results in the count being
            determined dynamically on startup.
        status : hikari.presences.Status
            The initial status to show for the user presence on startup.
            Defaults to `hikari.presences.Status.ONLINE`.
