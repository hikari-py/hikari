"""Typehints for `hikari.internal.enums`."""

# Enums use a lot of internal voodoo that will not type check nicely, so we
# skip that module with MyPy and just accept that "here be dragons".
#
# The caveat to implementing this is that MyPy has to have a special module to
# understand how to use Python's enum types. I really don't want to have to
# ship my own MyPy plugin for this, so just make MyPy think that the types
# we are using are just aliases from the enum types in the standard library.
