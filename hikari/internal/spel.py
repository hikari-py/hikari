"""HikariSPEL (Hikari SimPle Expression Language).

HikariSPEL (Hikari SimPle Expression Language) is a super-simple expression
language used in this module for quickly mapping values to other values and
producing streams of changes. This somewhat mirrors other programming languages
like Java which have a proper Stream API.

The concept of HikariSPEL is that you are trying to look at the attribute
of something. So, running `"bar.baz.bork"` against an object `foo` would be
equivalent to `foo.bar.baz.bork` in pure Python. The reason for doing this is
Python lambdas are clunky, and using a nested function is nasty boilerplate.

For applying `"bar.baz"` to `foo`, we assume `bar` is an attribute or property
of `foo`, and `baz` is an attribute or property of `foo.bar`. We may instead
want to invoke a method that takes no parameters (looking at `str.islower`, as
an example. To do this, we append `()` onto the attribute name. For example,
applying `author.username.islower()` to a `hikari.messages.Message`
object.

All expressions may start with a `.`. You can negate the whole expression
by instead starting them with `!.`.

You may also want to negate a condition. To do this, prepend `!` to the
attribute name. For example, to check if a message was not made by a bot,
you could run `author.!is_bot` on a `Message` object. Likewise, to check if
the input was not a number, you could run `content.!isdigit()`.

This expression language is highly experimental and may change without
prior notice for the time being.
