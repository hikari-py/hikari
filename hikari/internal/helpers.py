    Parameters
    ----------
    mentions_everyone : bool
        Whether `@everyone` and `@here` mentions should be resolved by
        discord and lead to actual pings.
    user_mentions : typing.Union[typing.Collection[typing.Union[hikari.users.User, hikari.bases.Snowflake, int]], bool]
        Either an array of user objects/IDs to allow mentions for,
        `True` to allow all user mentions or `False` to block all
        user mentions from resolving.
    role_mentions : typing.Union[typing.Collection[typing.Union[hikari.guilds.GuildRole, hikari.bases.Snowflake, int]], bool]
        Either an array of guild role objects/IDs to allow mentions for,
        `True` to allow all role mentions or `False` to block all
        role mentions from resolving.

    Returns
    -------
    typing.Dict[str, typing.Sequence[str]]
        The resulting allowed mentions dict object.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
        `role_mentions` or `user_mentions.
