    This is designed to be faster and more efficient than Python's
    implementation, while retaining the majority of the external interface
    that Python's `enum.Enum` provides.

    An `Enum` is a simple class containing a discrete set of constant values
    that can be used in place of this type. This acts as a type-safe way
    of representing a set number of "things".

    !!! warning
        Some semantics such as subtype checking and instance checking may
        differ. It is recommended to compare these values using the
        `==` operator rather than the `is` operator for safety reasons.

    Special Members on the class
    ----------------------------
    * `__enumtype__` :
        Always `Enum`.
    * `__members__` :
        An immutable `typing.Mapping` that maps each member name to the member
        value.
    * ` __objtype__` :
        Always the first type that the enum is derived from. For example:

    ```py
    >>> class UserType(str, Enum):
    ...     USER = "user"
    ...     PARTIAL = "partial"
    ...     MEMBER = "member"
    >>> print(UserType.__objtype__)
    <class 'builtins.str'>
    ```

    Operators on the class
    ----------------------
    * `EnumType["FOO"]` :
        Return the member that has the name `FOO`, raising a `builtins.KeyError`
        if it is not present.
    * `EnumType.FOO` :
        Return the member that has the name `FOO`, raising a
        `builtins.AttributeError` if it is not present.
    * `EnumType(x)` :
        Attempt to cast `x` to the enum type by finding an existing member that
        has the same __value__. If this fails, you should expect a
        `builtins.ValueError` to be raised.

    Operators on each enum member
    -----------------------------
    * `e1 == e2` : `builtins.bool`
        Compare equality.
    * `e1 != e2` : `builtins.bool`
        Compare inequality.
    * `builtins.repr(e)` : `builtins.str`
        Get the machine readable representation of the enum member `e`.
    * `builtins.str(e)` : `builtins.str`
        Get the `builtins.str` name of the enum member `e`.

    Special properties on each enum member
    --------------------------------------
    * `name` : `builtins.str`
        The name of the member.
    * `value` :
        The value of the member. The type depends on the implementation type
        of the enum you are using.

    All other methods and operators on enum members are inherited from the
    member's __value__. For example, an enum extending `builtins.int` would
    be able to be used as an `int` type outside these overridden definitions.

class Flag(metaclass=_FlagMeta):
    """Clone of Python's `enum.Flag` implementation.

    This is designed to be faster and more efficient than Python's
    implementation, while retaining the majority of the external interface
    that Python's `enum.Flag` provides.

    In simple terms, an `Flag` is a set of wrapped constant `builtins.int`
    values that can be combined in any combination to make a special value.
    This is a more efficient way of combining things like permissions together
    into a single integral value, and works by setting individual `1`s and `0`s
    on the binary representation of the integer.

    This implementation has extra features, in that it will actively behave
    like a `builtins.set` as well.

    !!! warning
        Despite wrapping `builtins.int` values, conceptually this does not
        behave as if it were a subclass of `int`.

    !!! danger
        Some semantics such as subtype checking and instance checking may
        differ. It is recommended to compare these values using the
        `==` operator rather than the `is` operator for safety reasons.

        Especially where pseudo-members created from combinations are cached,
        results of using of `is` may not be deterministic. This is a side
        effect of some internal performance improvements.

        Failing to observe this __will__ result in unexpected behaviour
        occurring in your application!

    Special Members on the class
    ----------------------------
    * `__enumtype__` :
        Always `Flag`.
    * `__everything__` :
        A special member with all documented bits set.
    * `__members__` :
        An immutable `typing.Mapping` that maps each member name to the member
        value.
    * ` __objtype__` :
        Always `builtins.int`.

    Operators on the class
    ----------------------
    * `FlagType["FOO"]` :
        Return the member that has the name `FOO`, raising a `builtins.KeyError`
        if it is not present.
    * `FlagType.FOO` :
        Return the member that has the name `FOO`, raising a
        `builtins.AttributeError` if it is not present.
    * `FlagType(x)` :
        Attempt to cast `x` to the enum type by finding an existing member that
        has the same __value__. If this fails, then a special __composite__
        instance of the type is made. The name of this type is a combination of
        all members that combine to make the bitwise value.

    Operators on each flag member
    -----------------------------
    * `e1 & e2` :
        Bitwise `AND` operation. Will return a member that contains all flags
        that are common between both oprands on the values. This also works with
        one of the oprands being an `builtins.int`eger. You may instead use
        the `intersection` method.
    * `e1 | e2` :
        Bitwise `OR` operation. Will return a member that contains all flags
        that appear on at least one of the oprands. This also works with
        one of the oprands being an `builtins.int`eger. You may instead use
        the `union` method.
    * `e1 ^ e2` :
        Bitwise `XOR` operation. Will return a member that contains all flags
        that only appear on at least one and at most one of the oprands.
        This also works with one of the oprands being an `builtins.int`eger.
        You may instead use the `symmetric_difference` method.
    * `~e` :
        Return the inverse of this value. This is equivalent to disabling all
        flags that are set on this value and enabling all flags that are
        not set on this value. Note that this will behave slightly differently
        to inverting a pure int value. You may instead use the `invert` method.
    * `e1 - e2` :
        Bitwise set difference operation. Returns all flags set on `e1` that are
        not set on `e2` as well. You may instead use the `difference`
        method.
    * `bool(e)` : `builtins.bool`
        Return `builtins.True` if `e` has a non-zero value, otherwise
        `builtins.False`.
    * `E.A in e`: `builtins.bool`
        `builtins.True` if `E.A` is in `e`. This is functionally equivalent
        to `E.A & e == E.A`.
    * `iter(e)` :
        Explode the value into a iterator of each __documented__ flag that can
        be combined to make up the value `e`. Returns an iterator across all
        well-defined flags that make up this value. This will only include the
        flags explicitly defined on this `Flag` type and that are individual
        powers of two (this means if converted to twos-compliment binary,
        exactly one bit must be a `1`). In simple terms, this means that you
        should not expect combination flags to be returned.
    * `e1 == e2` : `builtins.bool`
        Compare equality.
    * `e1 != e2` : `builtins.bool`
        Compare inequality.
    * `e1 < e2` : `builtins.bool`
        Compare by ordering.
    * `builtins.int(e)` : `builtins.int`
        Get the integer value of this flag
    * `builtins.repr(e)` : `builtins.str`
        Get the machine readable representation of the flag member `e`.
    * `builtins.str(e)` : `builtins.str`
        Get the `builtins.str` name of the flag member `e`.

    Special properties on each flag member
    --------------------------------------
    * `e.name` : `builtins.str`
        The name of the member. For composite members, this will be generated.
    * `e.value` : `builtins.int`
        The value of the member.

    Special members on each flag member
    -----------------------------------
    * `e.all(E.A, E.B, E.C, ...)` : `builtins.bool`
        Returns `builtins.True` if __all__ of `E.A`, `E.B`, `E.C`, et cetera
        make up the value of `e`.
    * `e.any(E.A, E.B, E.C, ...)` : `builtins.bool`
        Returns `builtins.True` if __any__ of `E.A`, `E.B`, `E.C`, et cetera
        make up the value of `e`.
    * `e.none(E.A, E.B, E.C, ...)` : `builtins.bool`
        Returns `builtins.True` if __none__ of `E.A`, `E.B`, `E.C`, et cetera
        make up the value of `e`.
    * `e.split()` : `typing.Sequence`
        Explode the value into a sequence of each __documented__ flag that can
        be combined to make up the value `e`. Returns a sorted sequence of each
        power-of-two flag that makes up the value `e`. This is equivalent to
        `list(iter(e))`.

    All other methods and operators on `Flag` members are inherited from the
    member's __value__.
