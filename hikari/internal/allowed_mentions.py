    Parameters
    ----------
    mentions_everyone : :obj:`~bool`
        Whether ``@everyone`` and ``@here`` mentions should be resolved by
        discord and lead to actual pings.
    user_mentions : :obj:`~typing.Union` [ :obj:`~typing.Collection` [ :obj:`~typing.Union` [ :obj:`~hikari.users.User`, :obj:`~hikari.bases.Snowflake`, :obj:`~int` ], :obj:`~bool` ]
        Either an array of user objects/IDs to allow mentions for,
        :obj:`~True` to allow all user mentions or :obj:`~False` to block all
        user mentions from resolving.
    role_mentions : :obj:`~typing.Union` [ :obj:`~typing.Collection` [ :obj:`~typing.Union` [ :obj:`~hikari.guilds.GuildRole`, :obj:`~hikari.bases.Snowflake`, :obj:`~int` ] ], :obj:`~bool` ]
        Either an array of guild role objects/IDs to allow mentions for,
        :obj:`~True` to allow all role mentions or :obj:`~False` to block all
        role mentions from resolving.

    Returns
    -------
    :obj:`~typing.Dict` [ :obj:`~str`, :obj:`~typing.Sequence` [ :obj:`~str` ] ]
        The resulting allowed mentions dict object.

    Raises
    ------
    :obj:`~ValueError`
        If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
        ``role_mentions`` or ``user_mentions.
