    This will handle Discord's ``before`` and ``after`` pagination.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deserializer : :obj:`~typing.Callable` [ [ :obj:`~typing.Any` ], :obj:`~typing.Any` ]
        The deserializer to use to deserialize raw elements.
    direction : :obj:`~typing.Union` [ ``"before"``, ``"after"`` ]
        The direction that this paginator should go in.
    request : :obj:`~typing.Callable` [ ``...``, :obj:`~typing.Coroutine` [ :obj:`~typing.Any`, :obj:`~typing.Any`, :obj:`~typing.Any` ] ]
        The :obj:`hikari.net.rest_sessions.LowLevelRestfulClient` method that should be
        called to make requests for this paginator.
    reversing : :obj:`~bool`
        Whether the retrieved array of objects should be reversed before
        iterating through it, this is needed for certain endpoints like
        ``fetch_messages_before`` where the order is static regardless of
        if you're using ``before`` or ``after``.
    start : :obj:`~int`, optional
        The snowflake ID that this paginator should start at, ``0`` may be
        passed for ``forward`` pagination to start at the first created
        entity and :obj:`~None` may be passed for ``before`` pagination to
        start at the newest entity (based on when it's snowflake timestamp).
    limit : :obj:`~int`, optional
        The amount of deserialized entities that the iterator should return
        total, will be unlimited if set to :obj:`~None`.
    id_getter : :obj:`~typing.Callable` [ [ :obj:`~typing.Any` ], :obj:`~str` ]
    **kwargs
        Kwargs to pass through to ``request`` for every request made along
        with the current decided limit and direction snowflake.

    Returns
    -------
    :obj:`~typing.AsyncIterator` [ :obj:`~typing.Any` ]
        An async iterator of the found deserialized found objects.
