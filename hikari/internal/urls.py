    route_parts : :obj:`str`
        The string route parts that will be used to form the link.
    fmt : :obj:`str`
        The format to use for the wanted cdn entity, will usually be one of
        ``webp``, ``png``, ``jpeg``, ``jpg`` or ``gif`` (which will be invalid
        if the target entity doesn't have an animated version available).
    size : :obj:`int`, optional
        The size to specify for the image in the query string if applicable,
        should be passed through as :obj:`None` to avoid the param being set.
        Must be any power of two between 16 and 4096.

    Returns
    -------
    :obj:`str`
        The URL to the resource on the Discord CDN.

    Raises
    ------
    :obj:`ValueError`
