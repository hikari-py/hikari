# Using an enum enables us to use typing.Literal. MyPy has a special case for
# assuming that the number of instances of a specific enum is limited by design,
# whereas using a constant value does not provide that. In short, this allows
# MyPy to determine it can statically cast a value to a different type when
# we do `is` and `is not` checks on values, which removes the need for casts.

    If you see this in a signature somewhere, it means you can pass a
    value of `UNDEFINED` and it will be valid.

    If you see this as the type of an attribute somewhere, it means that
    the attribute may be `UNDEFINED` in some edge cases.

    This exists to allow static type checkers to dereference this value
    using `typing.Literal`, which aids in static type analysis by treating
    this value as a true singleton. This can only be achieved by using
    an `enum.Enum` of a single value to enforce this.

    For all other purposes, you can treat this as the type of the
    `UNDEFINED` sentinel in this module. You should generally not need to
