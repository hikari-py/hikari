class Undefined(klass.Singleton):
    """A singleton value that represents an undefined field or argument.

    Undefined will always have a falsy value.

    This type exists to allow differentiation between values that are
    "optional" in the sense that they can be `None` (which is the
    definition of "optional" in Python's `typing` module), and
    values that are truly "optional" in that they may not be present.

    Some cases in Discord's API exist where passing a value as `None` or
    `null` have totally different semantics to not passing the value at all.
    The most noticeable case of this is for "patch" REST endpoints where
    specifying a value will cause it to be updated, but not specifying it
    will result in it being left alone.

    This type differs from `None` in a few different ways. Firstly,
    it will only ever be considered equal to itself, thus the following will
    always be false.

        >>> Undefined() == None
        False

    The type will always be equatable to itself.

        >>> Undefined() == Undefined()
        True

    The second differentiation is that you always instantiate this class to
    obtain an instance of it.

        >>> undefined_value = Undefined()

    ...since this is a singleton, this value will always return the same
    physical object. This improves efficiency.

    The third differentiation is that you can iterate across an undefined value.
    This is used to simplify logic elsewhere. The behaviour of iterating across
    an undefined value is to simply return an iterator that immediately
    completes.

        >>> [*Undefined()]
        []

    This type cannot be mutated, subclassed, or have attributes removed from it
    using conventional methods.
