    """Base type for an enum integer flag in Hikari.

    Provides a consistent way of producing human-readable strings, extra
    inspection utilities, and injects some boilerplate documentation. This
    should make the concept of using flags a little less daunting to those
    who are not yet used to the idea.

    Example
    -------

    ```py
    >>> class Permission(Flag):
    ...     CREATE = enum.auto()
    ...     READ = enum.auto()
    ...     UPDATE = enum.auto()
    ...     DELETE = enum.auto()

    >>> perms = Permission.CREATE | Permission.READ
    >>> print(perms.split())
    [Permission.CREATE, Permission.READ]
    ```

    This also provides two operators for clearer semantics of combining and
    removing flag members.

    ```py
    perms = Permission.CREATE + Permission.READ
    assert perms  == Permission.CREATE | Permission.READ

    perms -= Permission.CREATE
    assert perms == Permission.READ
    ```

    Members will be iterable if you wish to inspect each individual flag.

    ```py
    for p in Permission.CREATE + Permission.READ:
        print(p)
    ```
