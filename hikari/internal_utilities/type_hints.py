T = typing.TypeVar("T")

#: This can be considered the same as :class:`typing.Optional`, which is a value that can be
#: optionally set to `None`. We distinguish between `None` and not specifying something at all
#: when it is a default argument in several places, so this has been redefined with a clearer name.
Nullable = typing.Optional

#: A special type hint for an argument that can take the value of
#: :attr:`hikari.internal_utilities.unspecified.UNSPECIFIED`. This often defines a value that unless
#: explicitly changed, should be treated as if it is not there at all. This is used to distinguish
#: this case from a value being specified explicitly as `None`.
NotRequired = typing.Union[T, unspecified.Unspecified]

#: Shorthand for :attr:`Nullable` AND :attr:`NotRequired`.
