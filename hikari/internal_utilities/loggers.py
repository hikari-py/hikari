    """
    Builds an appropriately named logger. If called with no arguments or with `NoneType`, the current module is used
    to produce the name. If this is run from a location where no module info is available, a random UUID is used
    instead.

    If the passed object is an instance of a class, the class is used instead.

    If a class is provided/used, then the fully qualified package and class name is used to name the logger.

    If a string is provided, then the string is used as the name. This is not recommended.

    Args:
        obj:
            the object to study to produce a logger for.
        extra_objs:
            optional extra components to add to the end of the logger name.

    Returns:
        a created logger.
