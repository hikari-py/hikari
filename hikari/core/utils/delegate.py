    Make a decorator that wraps a class to make it delegate any inherited fields from `delegate_type` to attributes of
    the same name on a value stored in a field named the `magic_field`.

        delegate_type:
            The class that we wish to delegate to.

            The field that we will store an instance of the delegated type in.

    The idea behind this is to allow us to derive one class from another and allow initializing one instance
    from another. This is used largely by the `Member` implementation to allow more than one member to refer to
    the same underlying `User` at once.
