    waiters.

    Event listeners once registered will be stored until they are manually
    removed. Each time an event is dispatched with a matching name, they will
    be invoked on the event loop.

    One-time event waiters are futures that will be completed when a matching
    event is fired. Once they are matched, they are removed from the listener
    list. Each listener has a corresponding predicate that is invoked prior
    to completing the waiter, with any event parameters being passed to the
    predicate. If the predicate returns False, the waiter is not completed. This
    allows filtering of certain events and conditions in a procedural way.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event_type : :obj:`typing.Type` [ :obj:`events.HikariEvent` ]
            The name of the event to wait for.
        timeout : :obj:`float`, optional
            The timeout to wait for before cancelling and raising an
            :obj:`asyncio.TimeoutError` instead. If this is `None`, this will
            wait forever. Care must be taken if you use `None` as this may

            repeatedly called. If you want to do this, you should consider

        predicate : :obj:`typing.Callable` [ ..., :obj:`bool` ]
            A function that takes the arguments for the event and returns True

        -------

        Note
        ----
        Awaiting this result will raise an :obj:`asyncio.TimeoutError` if the timeout
        is hit and no match is found. If the predicate throws any exception,
        this is raised immediately.
