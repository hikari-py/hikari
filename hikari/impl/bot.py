class GatewayBot(traits.GatewayBotAware):
    """Basic auto-sharding bot implementation.

    This is the class you will want to use to start, control, and build a bot
    with.

    Parameters
    ----------
    token : builtins.str
        The bot token to sign in with.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    allow_color : builtins.bool
        Defaulting to `builtins.True`, this will enable coloured console logs
        on any platform that is a TTY.
        Setting a `"CLICOLOR"` environment variable to any **non `0`** value
        will override this setting.

        Users should consider this an advice to the application on whether it is
        safe to show colours if possible or not. Since some terminals can be
        awkward or not support features in a standard way, the option to
        explicitly disable this is provided. See `force_color` for an
        alternative.
    banner : typing.Optional[builtins.str]
        The package to search for a `banner.txt` in. Defaults to `"hikari"` for
        the `"hikari/banner.txt"` banner.
        Setting this to `builtins.None` will disable the banner being shown.
    executor : typing.Optional[concurrent.futures.Executor]
        Defaults to `builtins.None`. If non-`builtins.None`, then this executor
        is used instead of the `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` attached
        to the `asyncio.AbstractEventLoop` that the bot will run on. This
        executor is used primarily for file-IO.

        While mainly supporting the `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
        implementation in the standard lib, Hikari's file handling systems
        should also work with `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`, which
        relies on all objects used in IPC to be `pickle`able. Many third-party
        libraries will not support this fully though, so your mileage may vary
        on using ProcessPoolExecutor implementations with this parameter.
    force_color : builtins.bool
        Defaults to `builtins.False`. If `builtins.True`, then this application
        will __force__ colour to be used in console-based output. Specifying a
        `"CLICOLOR_FORCE"` environment variable with a non-`"0"` value will
        override this setting.
    cache_settings : typing.Optional[hikari.impl.config.CacheSettings]
        Optional cache settings. If unspecified, will use the defaults.
    http_settings : typing.Optional[hikari.impl.config.HTTPSettings]
        Optional custom HTTP configuration settings to use. Allows you to
        customise functionality such as whether SSL-verification is enabled,
        what timeouts `aiohttp` should expect to use for requests, and behavior
        regarding HTTP-redirects.
    intents : hikari.intents.Intents
        Defaults to `hikari.intents.Intents.ALL_UNPRIVILEGED`. This allows you
        to change which intents your application will use on the gateway. This
        can be used to control and change the types of events you will receive.
    logs : typing.Union[builtins.None, LoggerLevel, typing.Dict[str, typing.Any]]
        Defaults to `"INFO"`.

        If `builtins.None`, then the Python logging system is left uninitialized
        on startup, and you will need to configure it manually to view most
        logs that are output by components of this library.

        If one of the valid values in a `LoggerLevel`, then this will match a
        call to `colorlog.basicConfig` (a facade for `logging.basicConfig` with
        additional conduit for enabling coloured logging levels) with the
        `level` kwarg matching this value.

        If a `typing.Dict[str, typing.Any]` equivalent, then this value is
        passed to `logging.config.dictConfig` to allow the user to provide a
        specialized logging configuration of their choice. If any handlers are
        defined in the dict, default handlers will not be setup.

        As a side note, you can always opt to leave this on the default value
        and then use an incremental `logging.config.dictConfig` that applies
        any additional changes on top of the base configuration, if you prefer.
        An example of can be found in the `Example` section.

        Note that `"TRACE_HIKARI"` is a library-specific logging level
        which is expected to be more verbose than `"DEBUG"`.
    max_rate_limit : builtins.float
        The max number of seconds to backoff for when rate limited. Anything
        greater than this will instead raise an error.

        This defaults to five minutes if left to the default value. This is to
        stop potentially indefinitely waiting on an endpoint, which is almost
        never what you want to do if giving a response to a user.

        You can set this to `float("inf")` to disable this check entirely.

        Note that this only applies to the REST API component that communicates
        with Discord, and will not affect sharding or third party HTTP endpoints
        that may be in use.
    max_retries : typing.Optional[builtins.int]
        Maximum number of times a request will be retried if
        it fails with a `5xx` status. Defaults to 3 if set to `builtins.None`.
    proxy_settings : typing.Optional[hikari.impl.config.ProxySettings]
        Custom proxy settings to use with network-layer logic
        in your application to get through an HTTP-proxy.
    rest_url : typing.Optional[builtins.str]
        Defaults to the Discord REST API URL if `builtins.None`. Can be
        overridden if you are attempting to point to an unofficial endpoint, or
        if you are attempting to mock/stub the Discord API for any reason.
        Generally you do not want to change this.

    !!! note
        `force_color` will always take precedence over `allow_color`.

    !!! note
        Settings that control the gateway session are provided to the
        `GatewayBot.run` and `GatewayBot.start` functions in this class. This is done
        to allow you to contextually customise details such as sharding
        configuration without having to re-initialize the entire application
        each time.

    Example
    -------
    Setting up logging using a dictionary configuration:

    ```py
    import os

    import hikari

    # We want to make gateway logs output as DEBUG, and TRACE for all ratelimit content.
    bot = hikari.GatewayBot(
        token=os.environ["BOT_TOKEN"],
        logs={
            "version": 1,
            "incremental": True,
            "loggers": {
                "hikari.gateway": {"level": "DEBUG"},
                "hikari.ratelimits": {"level": "TRACE_HIKARI"},
            },
        },
    )
    ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        event : hikari.events.base_events.Event
            The event to dispatch.

        Example
        -------
        We can dispatch custom events by first defining a class that
        derives from `hikari.events.base_events.Event`.

        ```py
        import attr

        from hikari.traits import RESTAware
        from hikari.events.base_events import Event
        from hikari.users import User
        from hikari.snowflakes import Snowflake

        @attr.define()
        class EveryoneMentionedEvent(Event):
            app: RESTAware = attr.field()

            author: User = attr.field()
            '''The user who mentioned everyone.'''

            content: str = attr.field()
            '''The message that was sent.'''

            message_id: Snowflake = attr.field()
            '''The message ID.'''

            channel_id: Snowflake = attr.field()
            '''The channel ID.'''
        ```

        We can then dispatch our event as we see fit.

        ```py
        from hikari.events.messages import MessageCreateEvent

        @bot.listen(MessageCreateEvent)
        async def on_message(event):
            if "@everyone" in event.content or "@here" in event.content:
                event = EveryoneMentionedEvent(

                    message_id=event.id,
                    channel_id=event.channel_id,

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        activity : typing.Optional[hikari.presences.Activity]
            The initial activity to display in the bot user presence, or
            `builtins.None` (default) to not show any.
        afk : builtins.bool
            The initial AFK state to display in the bot user presence, or
            `builtins.False` (default) to not show any.
        asyncio_debug : builtins.bool
            Defaults to `builtins.False`. If `builtins.True`, then debugging is
            enabled for the asyncio event loop in use.
        check_for_updates : builtins.bool
            Defaults to `builtins.True`. If `builtins.True`, will check for
            newer versions of `hikari` on PyPI and notify if available.
        close_passed_executor : builtins.bool
            Defaults to `builtins.False`. If `builtins.True`, any custom
            `concurrent.futures.Executor` passed to the constructor will be
            shut down when the application terminates. This does not affect the
            default executor associated with the event loop, and will not
            do anything if you do not provide a custom executor to the
            constructor.
        close_loop : builtins.bool
            Defaults to `builtins.True`. If `builtins.True`, then once the bot
            enters a state where all components have shut down permanently
            during application shutdown, then all asyncgens and background tasks
            will be destroyed, and the event loop will be shut down.

            This will wait until all `hikari`-owned `aiohttp` connectors have
            had time to attempt to shut down correctly (around 250ms), and on
            Python 3.9 and newer, will also shut down the default event loop
            executor too.
        coroutine_tracking_depth : typing.Optional[builtins.int]
            Defaults to `builtins.None`. If an integer value and supported by
            the interpreter, then this many nested coroutine calls will be
            tracked with their call origin state. This allows you to determine
            where non-awaited coroutines may originate from, but generally you
            do not want to leave this enabled for performance reasons.
        enable_signal_handlers : typing.Optional[builtins.bool]
            Defaults to `builtins.True` if this is started in the main thread.

            If on a __non-Windows__ OS with builtin support for kernel-level
            POSIX signals, then setting this to `builtins.True` will allow
            treating keyboard interrupts and other OS signals to safely shut
            down the application as calls to shut down the application properly
            rather than just killing the process in a dirty state immediately.
            You should leave this enabled unless you plan to implement your own
            signal handling yourself.
        idle_since : typing.Optional[datetime.datetime]
            The `datetime.datetime` the user should be marked as being idle
            since, or `builtins.None` (default) to not show this.
        ignore_session_start_limit : builtins.bool
            Defaults to `builtins.False`. If `builtins.False`, then attempting
            to start more sessions than you are allowed in a 24 hour window
            will throw a `hikari.errors.GatewayError` rather than going ahead
            and hitting the IDENTIFY limit, which may result in your token
            being reset. Setting to `builtins.True` disables this behavior.
        large_threshold : builtins.int
            Threshold for members in a guild before it is treated as being
            "large" and no longer sending member details in the `GUILD CREATE`
            event. Defaults to `250`.
        propagate_interrupts : builtins.bool
            Defaults to `builtins.False`. If set to `builtins.True`, then any
            internal `hikari.errors.HikariInterrupt` that is raises as a
            result of catching an OS level signal will result in the
            exception being rethrown once the application has closed. This can
            allow you to use hikari signal handlers and still be able to
            determine what kind of interrupt the application received after
            it closes. When `builtins.False`, nothing is raised and the call
            will terminate cleanly and silently where possible instead.
        shard_ids : typing.Optional[typing.AbstractSet[builtins.int]]
            The shard IDs to create shards for. If not `builtins.None`, then
            a non-`None` `shard_count` must ALSO be provided. Defaults to
            `builtins.None`, which means the Discord-recommended count is used
            for your application instead.
        shard_count : typing.Optional[builtins.int]
            The number of shards to use in the entire distributed application.
            Defaults to `builtins.None` which results in the count being
            determined dynamically on startup.
        status : hikari.presences.Status
            The initial status to show for the user presence on startup.
            Defaults to `hikari.presences.Status.ONLINE`.

            The shard IDs to create shards for. If not `builtins.None`, then
            a non-`None` `shard_count` must ALSO be provided. Defaults to
            `builtins.None`, which means the Discord-recommended count is used
            for your application instead.
        shard_count : typing.Optional[builtins.int]
            The number of shards to use in the entire distributed application.
            Defaults to `builtins.None` which results in the count being
            determined dynamically on startup.
        status : hikari.presences.Status
            The initial status to show for the user presence on startup.
            Defaults to `hikari.presences.Status.ONLINE`.

        timeout : typing.Optional[builtins.int, builtins.float]
            How long this streamer should wait for the next event before

        Returns
        -------
        EventStream[hikari.events.base_events.Event]
            The async iterator to handle streamed events. This must be started
            with `with stream:` or `stream.open()` before
            asynchronously iterating over it.

        !!! warning
            If you use `stream.open()` to start the stream then you must
            also close it with `stream.close()` otherwise it may queue
            events in memory indefinitely.

        Examples
        --------

        ```py
        with bot.stream(events.ReactionAddEvent, timeout=30).filter(("message_id", message.id)) as stream:
            async for user_id in stream.map("user_id").limit(50):
                ...
        ```

        or using `open()` and `close()`

        ```py
        stream = bot.stream(events.ReactionAddEvent, timeout=30).filter(("message_id", message.id))
        stream.open()
