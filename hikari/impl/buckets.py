"""Rate-limit extensions for RESTful bucketed endpoints.

Provides implementations for the complex rate limiting mechanisms that Discord
requires for rate limit handling that conforms to the passed bucket headers
correctly.

This was initially a bit of a headache for me to understand, personally, since
there is a lot of "implicit detail" that is easy to miss from the documentation.

In an attempt to make this somewhat understandable by anyone else, I have tried
to document the theory of how this is handled here.

What is the theory behind this implementation?
----------------------------------------------

In this module, we refer to a `hikari.internal.routes.CompiledRoute` as a definition
of a route with specific major parameter values included (e.g.
`POST /channels/123/messages`), and a `hikari.internal.routes.Route` as a
definition of a route without specific parameter values included (e.g.
`POST /channels/{channel}/messages`). We can compile a
`hikari.internal.routes.CompiledRoute` from a `hikari.internal.routes.Route`
by providing the corresponding parameters as kwargs, as you may already know.

In this module, a "bucket" is an internal data structure that tracks and
enforces the rate limit state for a specific `hikari.internal.routes.CompiledRoute`,
and can manage delaying tasks in the event that we begin to get rate limited.
It also supports providing in-order execution of queued tasks.

Discord allocates types of buckets to routes. If you are making a request and
there is a valid rate limit on the route you hit, you should receive an
`X-RateLimit-Bucket` header from the server in your response. This is a hash
that identifies a route based on internal criteria that does not include major
parameters. This `X-RateLimitBucket` is known in this module as an "bucket hash".

This means that generally, the route `POST /channels/123/messages` and
`POST /channels/456/messages` will usually sit in the same bucket, but
`GET /channels/123/messages/789` and `PATCH /channels/123/messages/789` will
usually not share the same bucket. Discord may or may not change this at any
time, so hard coding this logic is not a useful thing to be doing.

Rate limits, on the other hand, apply to a bucket and are specific to the major
parameters of the compiled route. This means that `POST /channels/123/messages`
and `POST /channels/456/messages` do not share the same real bucket, despite
Discord providing the same bucket hash. A real bucket hash is the `builtins.str` hash of
the bucket that Discord sends us in a response concatenated to the corresponding
major parameters. This is used for quick bucket indexing internally in this
module.

One issue that occurs from this is that we cannot effectively hash a
`hikari.internal.routes.CompiledRoute` that has not yet been hit, meaning that
until we receive a response from this endpoint, we have no idea what our rate
limits could be, nor the bucket that they sit in. This is usually not
problematic, as the first request to an endpoint should never be rate limited
unless you are hitting it from elsewhere in the same time window outside your
hikari.applications. To manage this situation, unknown endpoints are allocated to
a special unlimited bucket until they have an initial bucket hash code allocated
from a response. Once this happens, the route is reallocated a dedicated bucket.
Unknown buckets have a hardcoded initial hash code internally.

Initially acquiring time on a bucket
------------------------------------

Each time you `BaseRateLimiter.acquire()` a request timeslice for a given
`hikari.internal.routes.Route`, several things happen. The first is that we
attempt to find the existing bucket for that route, if there is one, or get an
unknown bucket otherwise. This is done by creating a real bucket hash from the
compiled route. The initial hash is calculated using a lookup table that maps
`hikari.internal.routes.CompiledRoute` objects to their corresponding initial hash
codes, or to the unknown bucket hash code if not yet known. This initial hash is
processed by the `hikari.internal.routes.CompiledRoute` to provide the real bucket
hash we need to get the route's bucket object internally.

The `BaseRateLimiter.acquire()` method will take the bucket and acquire a new
timeslice on it. This takes the form of a `asyncio.Future` which should be
awaited by the caller and will complete once the caller is allowed to make a
request. Most of the time, this is done instantly, but if the bucket has an
active rate limit preventing requests being sent, then the future will be paused
until the rate limit is over. This may be longer than the rate limit period if
you have queued a large number of requests during this limit, as it is
first-come-first-served.

Acquiring a rate limited bucket will start a bucket-wide task (if not already
running) that will wait until the rate limit has completed before allowing more
futures to complete. This is done while observing the rate limits again, so can
easily begin to re-ratelimit itself if needed. Once the task is complete, it
tidies itself up and disposes of itself. This task will complete once the queue
becomes empty.

The result of `RESTBucketManager.acquire()` is a tuple of a `asyncio.Future` to
await on which completes when you are allowed to proceed with making a request,
and a real bucket hash which should be stored temporarily. This will be
explained in the next section.

Handling the rate limit headers of a response
---------------------------------------------

Once you have received your response, you are expected to extract the values of
the vital rate limit headers manually and parse them to the correct data types.
These headers are:

* `X-RateLimit-Limit`:
    an `builtins.int` describing the max requests in the bucket from empty to
    being rate limited.
* `X-RateLimit-Remaining`:
    an `builtins.int` describing the remaining number of requests before rate
    limiting occurs in the current window.
* `X-RateLimit-Bucket`:
    a `builtins.str` containing the initial bucket hash.
* `X-RateLimit-Reset-After`:
    a `builtins.float` containing the number of seconds when the current rate
    limit bucket will reset with decimal millisecond precision.

Each of the above values should be passed to the `update_rate_limits` method to
ensure that the bucket you acquired time from is correctly updated should
Discord decide to alter their ratelimits on the fly without warning (including
timings and the bucket).

This method will manage creating new buckets as needed and resetting vital
information in each bucket you use.

Tidying up
----------

To prevent unused buckets cluttering up memory, each `RESTBucketManager`
instance spins up a `asyncio.Task` that periodically locks the bucket list
(not threadsafe, only using the concept of asyncio not yielding in regular
functions) and disposes of any clearly stale buckets that are no longer needed.
These will be recreated again in the future if they are needed.

When shutting down an application, one must remember to `close()` the
`RESTBucketManager` that has been used. This will ensure the garbage collection
task is stopped, and will also ensure any remaining futures in any bucket queues
have an `asyncio.CancelledError` set on them to prevent deadlocking ratelimited
calls that may be waiting to be unlocked.

Body-field-specific rate limiting
---------------------------------

As of the start of June, 2020, Discord appears to be enforcing another layer
of rate limiting logic to their HTTP APIs which is field-specific. This means
that special rate limits will also exist on some endpoints that limit based
on what attributes you send in a JSON or form data payload.

No information is sent in headers about these specific limits. You will only
be made aware that they exist once you get ratelimited. In the 429 ratelimited
response, you will have the `"global"` attribute set to `builtins.False`, and a
`"reset_after"` attribute that differs entirely to the `X-RateLimit-Reset-After`
header. Thus, it is important to not assume the value in the 429 response
for the reset time is the same as the one in the bucket headers. Hikari's
`hikari.api.rest.RESTClient` implementation specifically uses the value furthest
in the future when working out which bucket to adhere to.

It is worth remembering that there is an API limit to the number of 401s,
403s, and 429s you receive, which is around 10,000 per 15 minutes. Passing this
limit results in a soft ban of your account.

At the time of writing, the only example of this appears to be on the
`PATCH /channels/{channel_id}` endpoint. This has a limit of two changes per
10 minutes. More details about how this is implemented have yet to be
released or documented...
