    Parameters
    ----------
    config : hikari.utilities.undefined.Undefined or hikari.net.http_settings.HTTPSettings
        Optional aiohttp settings to apply to the REST components. If undefined,
        then sane defaults are used.
    debug : bool
        Defaulting to `False`, if `True`, then each payload sent and received
        in HTTP requests will be dumped to debug logs. This will provide useful
        debugging context at the cost of performance. Generally you do not
        need to enable this.
    token : hikari.utilities.undefined.Undefined or str
        If defined, the token to use. If not defined, no token will be injected
        into the `Authorization` header for requests.
    token_type : hikari.utilities.undefined.Undefined or str
        The token type to use. If undefined, a default is used instead, which
        will be `Bot`. If no `token` is provided, this is ignored.
    url : hikari.utilities.undefined.Undefined or str
        The API URL to hit. Generally you can leave this undefined and use the
        default.
    version : int
        The API version to use. This is interpolated into the default `url`
        to create the full URL. Currently this only supports `6` or `7`, and
        defaults to `6` (since the v7 REST API is experimental, undocumented,
        and subject to breaking change without prior notice at any time).
