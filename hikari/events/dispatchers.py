        Parameters

        event_type : typing.Type[hikari.events.base.HikariEvent]

        timeout : float, optional
            The timeout to wait for before cancelling and raising an
            `asyncio.TimeoutError` instead. If this is `None`, this
            will wait forever. Care must be taken if you use `None` as this
            may leak memory if you do this from an event listener that gets
            repeatedly called. If you want to do this, you should consider

        predicate : `def predicate(event) -> bool` or `async def predicate(event) -> bool`

            This can be a coroutine function that returns a boolean, or a
            regular function.

        Returns
        -------
        asyncio.Future
            A future to await. When the given event is matched, this will be
            completed with the corresponding event body.

            If the predicate throws an exception, or the timeout is reached,
            then this will be set as an exception on the returned future.

        !!! note
            The event type is not expected to be considered in a polymorphic
            lookup, but can be implemented this way optionally if documented.

    ) -> typing.Callable[[EventCallbackT], EventCallbackT]:
        """Return a decorator equivalent to invoking `EventDispatcher.add_listener`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event_type : typing.Type[hikari.events.base.HikariEvent], optional
            The event type to register the produced decorator to. If this is not
            specified, then the given function is used instead and the type hint
            of the first argument is considered. If no type hint is present
            there either, then the call will fail.

        Usage
        -----
        This can be used in two ways. The first is to pass the event type
        to the decorator directly.

            @bot.event(hikari.MessageCreatedEvent)
            async def on_message(event):
                print(event.content)

        The second method is to provide typehints instead. This allows you
        to write code that works with a static type checker without needing
        to specify the event type twice.

            # Type-hinted format.
            @bot.event()
            async def on_message(event: hikari.MessageCreatedEvent) -> None:
                print(event.content)

        If you do not provide the event type in the decorator, and you do not
        provide a valid type hint, then a `TypeError` will be raised.

        You can subscribe to multiple events in two ways.

        The first way is to subscribe to a base class of each event you want
        to listen to. Base classes are described in this documentation on each
        event type.

        An example would be listening to every event that occurs.

            @bot.event(hikari.HikariEvent)
            async def on_event(event):
                print(event)

        The other method is to apply the decorator more than once.

            @bot.event(hikari.MessageCreateEvent)
            @bot.event(hikari.MessageDeleteEvent)
            async def on_create_delete(event):
                print(event)

        Returns
        -------
        decorator(T) -> T
            A decorator for a function that registers the given event.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError:
            If a function with an invalid signature is passed, or if no event
            type is used in the decorator or as a type hint.
