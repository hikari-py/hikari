class File(typing.AsyncIterable[bytes]):
    """A file object.

    It is an async iterator of bytes that is compatible with being passed into
    aiohttp requests and read asynchronously. By doing this, it facades multiple
    otherwise incompatible and sometimes blocking IO protocols that Python provides
    in a way that should be simple to use and require as little consideration from
    the user as possible.

    In short, it is a facade for `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`, `io.BytesIO`,
    `io.IOBase`, `Iterator[bytes]`, `Iterator[bytearray]`, `AsyncIterator[bytes]`,
    `AsyncIterator[bytearray]`, and for file-system paths that are passed as either
    `str` or `os.PathLike` objects.

    !!! note
        This class is an async iterable, so it can be iterated across asynchronously
        to yield arbitrary sized chunks of `bytes` objects from the data stream.

        These iterators do not alter any internal seek of the stream, but will
        result in the data being cached in-memory after the first full iteration.
