    does so by implementing rate-limits on the usage of specific fields only.

    time has passed, either discarding the operation you performed, or waiting
    until the given time has passed first. Note that it may still be valid to
    send requests with different attributes in them.

    A use case for this by Discord appears to be to stop abuse from bots that
    change channel names, etc, regularly. This kind of action allegedly causes
    a fair amount of overhead internally for Discord. In the case you encounter
    this, you may be able to send different requests that manipulate the same
    entities (in this case editing the same channel) that do not use the same
    collection of attributes as the previous request.

    You should not usually see this occur, unless Discord vastly change their
    ratelimit system without prior warning, which might happen in the future.

        If you receive this regularly, please file a bug report, or contact
