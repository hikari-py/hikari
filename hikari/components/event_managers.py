    """Abstract definition of the application for an event system for a bot.

    The class itself inherits from
    `hikari.components.consumers.RawEventConsumer` (which allows it to provide the
    ability to transform a raw payload into an event object).

    This is designed as a basis to enable transformation of raw incoming events
    from the websocket into more usable native Python objects, and to then
    dispatch them to a given event dispatcher. It does not provide the logic for
    how to specifically parse each event however.

     !!! note
        This object will detect internal event mapper functions by looking for
        coroutine functions wrapped with `raw_event_mapper`.

        These methods are expected to have the following parameters:

        * shard_obj : `hikari.gateway.client.GatewayClient`

            The shard client that emitted the event.

        * payload : `typing.Any`

            The received payload. This is expected to be a JSON-compatible type.

        For example, if you want to provide an implementation that can consume
        and handle `MESSAGE_CREATE` events, you can do the following.

            class MyMappingEventConsumer(MappingEventConsumer):
                @event_mapper("MESSAGE_CREATE")
                def _process_message_create(self, shard, payload) -> MessageCreateEvent:
                    return MessageCreateEvent.deserialize(payload)

        The decorator can be stacked if you wish to provide one mapper

        ... it is pretty simple. This is exposed in this way to enable you to
        write code that may use a distributed system instead of a single-process
        bot.

        Writing to a message queue is pretty simple using this mechanism, as you
        can choose when and how to place the event on a queue to be consumed by
        other application application.

        For the sake of simplicity, Hikari only provides implementations for
        single process bots, since most of what you will need will be fairly
        bespoke if you want to implement anything more complicated; regardless,
        the tools are here for you to use as you see fit.

    !!! warning
        This class provides the scaffold for making an event consumer, but doe
        not physically implement the logic to deserialize and process specific
        events.

        To provide this, use one of the provided implementations of this class,
        or create your own as needed.

    app: hikari.components.application.Application
