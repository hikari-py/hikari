import enum


@enum.unique
class Permission(enum.IntFlag):
    """Represents the permissions available in a given channel or guild.

    This is an int-flag enum. This means that you can **combine multiple
    permissions together** into one value using the bitwise-OR operator (`|`).

        my_perms = Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD

        your_perms = (
            Permission.CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE
            | Permission.KICK_MEMBERS
            | Permission.BAN_MEMBERS
            | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD
        )

    You can **check if a permission is present** in a set of combined
    permissions by using the bitwise-AND operator (`&`). This will return
    the int-value of the permission if it is present, or `0` if not present.

        my_perms = Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD

        if my_perms & Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS:
            if my_perms & Permission.MANAGE_GUILD:
                print("I have the permission to both manage the guild and the channels in it!")
            else:
                print("I have the permission to manage channels!")
        else:
            print("I don't have the permission to manage channels!")

        # Or you could simplify it:

        if my_perms & (Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD):
            print("I have the permission to both manage the guild and the channels in it!")
        elif my_perms & Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS:
            print("I have the permission to manage channels!")
        else:
            print("I don't have the permission to manage channels!")

    If you need to **check that a permission is not present**, you can use the
    bitwise-XOR operator (`^`) to check. If the permission is not present, it
    will return a non-zero value, otherwise if it is present, it will return `0`.

        my_perms = Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permission.MANAGE_GUILD

        if my_perms ^ Permission.MANAGE_CHANNELS:
            print("Please give me the MANAGE_CHANNELS permission!")

    Lastly, if you need all the permissions set except the permission you want,
    you can use the inversion operator (`~`) to do that.
