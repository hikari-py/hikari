"""Shard intents for controlling which events the application receives.

thus `intents.Intent.GUILDS` will behave the same as `intents.GUILDS`.

@typing.final
class Intent(flag.Flag):
    """Represents an intent on the gateway.

    This is a bitfield representation of all the categories of event
    that you wish to receive.

    Any events not in an intent category will be fired regardless of what
    intents you provide.

    !!! info
        Discord now places limits on certain events you can receive without
        whitelisting your bot first. On the `Bot` tab in the developer's portal
        for your bot, you should now have the option to enable functionality
        for receiving these events.

        If you attempt to request an intent type that you have not whitelisted
        your bot for, you will be disconnected on startup with a `4014` closure
        code.

    !!! warning
        If you are using the V7 Gateway, you will be REQUIRED to provide some
        form of intent value when you connect. Failure to do so may result in
        immediate termination of the session server-side.

    This enum is an `enum.IntFlag`, which means that you can use bitwise
    operators to join and splice multiple intents into one value.

    For example, if we wish to only refer to the `GUILDS` intent, then it is
    simply a case of accessing it normally.

    ```py
    my_intents = Intent.GUILDS
    ```

    If we wanted to have several intents grouped together, we would use the
    bitwise-or operator to combine them (`|`). This can be done in-place
    with the `|=` operator if needed.

    ```py
    # One or two values that fit on one line.
    my_intents = Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.DIRECT_MESSAGES

    # Several intents together. You may find it useful to format these like
    # so to keep your code readable.
    my_intents = (
        Intents.GUILDS             |
        Intents.GUILD_BANS         |
        Intents.GUILD_EMOJIS       |
        Intents.GUILD_INTEGRATIONS |
        Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES     |
        Intents.DIRECT_MESSAGES
    )
    ```

    To check if an intent **is present** in a given intents bitfield, you can
    use the bitwise-and operator (`&`) to check. This returns the "intersection"
    or "crossover" between the left and right-hand side of the `&`. You can then
    use the `==` operator to check that specific values are present. You can
    check in-place with the `&=` operator if needed.

    ```py
    if (my_intents & Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES) == Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES:
        print("Guild messages are enabled")

    # Checking if ALL in a combination are set:
    expected_intents = (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.DIRECT_MESSAGES)
    if (my_intents & expected_intents) == expected_intents:
        print("Messages are enabled in guilds and direct messages.")

    # Checking if AT LEAST ONE in a combination is set:
    expected_intents = (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.DIRECT_MESSAGES)
    if my_intents & expected_intents:
        print("Messages are enabled in guilds or direct messages.")
    ```

    Removing one or more intents from a combination can be done with the
    bitwise-xor (`^`) operator. The `^=` operator can do this in-place.

    ```py
    # Remove GUILD_MESSAGES
    my_intents = my_intents ^ Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES
    # or, simplifying:
    my_intents ^= Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES

    # Remove all messages events.
    my_intents = my_intents ^ (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.DIRECT_MESSAGES)
    # or, simplifying
    my_intents ^= (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.DIRECT_MESSAGES)
    ```
