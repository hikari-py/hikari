    This is a bitfield representation of all the categories of event
    that you wish to receive.

    Any events not in an intent category will be fired regardless of what
    intents you provide.

    !!! info
        Discord now places limits on certain events you can receive without
        whitelisting your bot first. On the `Bot` tab in the developer's portal
        for your bot, you should now have the option to enable functionality
        for receiving these events.

        If you attempt to request an intent type that you have not whitelisted
        your bot for, you will be disconnected on startup with a `4014` closure
        code.

    !!! warning
        If you are using the V7 Gateway, you will be REQUIRED to provide some
        form of intent value when you connect. Failure to do so may result in
        immediate termination of the session server-side.
