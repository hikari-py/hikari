"""Provides the internal framework for processing the lifetime of a bot.

The API for this part of the framework has been split into groups of
abstract base classes, and corresponding implementations. This allows
several key components to be implemented separately, in case you have a
specific use case you want to provide (such as placing stuff on a message
queue if you distribute your bot).

The overall structure is as follows:

.. inheritance-diagram::
    hikari.state.event_dispatcher
    hikari.state.raw_event_consumer
    hikari.state.event_manager
    hikari.state.stateless_event_manager_impl
"""
