class EventManager(typing.Generic[EventDispatcherT], raw_event_consumers.RawEventConsumer):
    """Abstract definition of the components for an event system for a bot.

    The class itself inherits from
    :obj:`hikari.state.raw_event_consumer.RawEventConsumer` (which allows
    it to provide the ability to transform a raw payload into an event object).

    This is designed as a basis to enable transformation of raw incoming events
    from the websocket into more usable native Python objects, and to then
    dispatch them to a given event dispatcher. It does not provide the logic for
    how to specifically parse each event however.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_dispatcher_impl: :obj:`hikari.state.event_dispatcher.EventDispatcher`, optional
        An implementation of event dispatcher that will store individual events
        and manage dispatching them after this object creates them. If ``None``,
        then a default implementation is chosen.

    Notes
    -----
    This object will detect internal event mapper functions by looking for
    coroutine functions wrapped with :obj:`raw_event_mapper`.

    These methods are expected to have the following parameters:

        shard_obj: :obj:`hikari.clients.shard_client.ShardClient`
            The shard client that emitted the event.
        payload: :obj:`typing.Any`
            The received payload. This is expected to be a JSON-compatible type.

    For example, if you want to provide an implementation that can consume
    and handle ``MESSAGE_CREATE`` events, you can do the following.

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyMappingEventConsumer(MappingEventConsumer):
            @event_mapper("MESSAGE_CREATE")
            def _process_message_create(self, shard, payload) -> MessageCreateEvent:
                return MessageCreateEvent.deserialize(payload)

    The decorator can be stacked if you wish to provide one mapper

    ... it is pretty simple. This is exposed in this way to enable you to write
    code that may use a distributed system instead of a single-process bot.

    Writing to a message queue is pretty simple using this mechanism, as you can
    choose when and how to place the event on a queue to be consumed by other
    application components.

    For the sake of simplicity, Hikari only provides implementations for single
    process bots, since most of what you will need will be fairly bespoke if you
    want to implement anything more complicated; regardless, the tools are here
    for you to use as you see fit.

    Warnings
    --------
    This class provides the scaffold for making an event consumer, but does not
    physically implement the logic to deserialize and process specific events.

    To provide this, use one of the provided implementations of this class, or
    create your own as needed.
