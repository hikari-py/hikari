class IntentAwareEventDispatcherImpl(dispatchers.EventDispatcher):
    """Handles storing and dispatching to event listeners and one-time event waiters.

    Event listeners once registered will be stored until they are manually
    removed. Each time an event is dispatched with a matching name, they will
    be invoked on the event loop.

    One-time event waiters are futures that will be completed when a matching
    event is fired. Once they are matched, they are removed from the listener
    list. Each listener has a corresponding predicate that is invoked prior
    to completing the waiter, with any event parameters being passed to the
    predicate. If the predicate returns False, the waiter is not completed. This
    allows filtering of certain events and conditions in a procedural way.

    Events that require a specific intent will trigger warnings on subscription
    if the provided enabled intents are not a superset of this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    enabled_intents : :obj:`~hikari.intents.Intent`, optional
        The intents that are enabled for the application. If ``None``, then no
        intent checks are performed when subscribing a new event.
