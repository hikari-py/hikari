# Usage Guide

This guide will show developers how exactly they can use `hikari`. It will go over using the `GatewayBot` to listen for and handle dispatched events from Discord.

`hikari` is a lightweight and modular Discord bot library. You can create gateway applications (those that communicate with a websocket with Discord directly) or REST API applications (communicating over HTTP). The most common is the gateway application, implemented with `GatewayBot`.

`hikari` is written in Python and supports `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`, and `3.14`.
Environment setup will be discussed in a further page.

It is recommended that you read and understand all of Discord's interaction objects and functionality before moving further, discussed in [[Definitions]](definitions.md).

To get started, start by visiting the [[Creating an OAuth2 application]](oauth2.md) page.
