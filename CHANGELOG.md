---


## 2.0.0.dev118 (2023-04-02)

### Breaking Changes

- Refactors to the component builder interfaces which make them flatter:

  * Removed `add_to_container` from `ButtonBuilder`, `LinkButtonBuilder`, `InteractiveButtonBuilder`, `SelectMenuBuilder`, `ChannelSelectMenuBuilder`, and `TextInputBuilder`; these classes are no-longer generic and no-longer take `container` in their inits.
  * Replaced `TextSelectMenuBuilder.add_to_container` with the `TextSelectMenuBuilder.parent` property.
      This new property doesn't "finalise" the addition but rather just returns the parent object, or raises if the select menu is an orphan. This change also involves replacing the `container` parameter in `TextSelectMenuBuilder.__init__` with an optional `parent` parameter.
  * Removed `SelectOptionBuilder.add_to_menu`; this class isn't generic anymore.
  * `TextSelectMenuBuilder.add_option` now takes all the option's configuration as parameters and returns `Self`.
  * Split `MessageActionRowBuilder.add_button` into `.add_interactive_button` and `.add_link_button`.
      These both now take all the button's configuration as parameters and return `Self`.
  * `MessageActionRowBuilder.add_select_menu` now takes all the menu's configuration as parameters and returns `Self`.
      The new `.add_channel_menu` and `.add_text_menu` methods should be used for adding text and channel menus. Where `.add_channel_menu` returns `Self` and `.add_text_menu` returns a text menu builder with a `parent` property for getting back to the action row builder.
  * `ModalActionRowBuilder.add_text_input` now takes all the text input's configuration as parameters and returns `Self`.
  * `min_length` and `max_length` can no-longer be `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED` for the text input builder, and default to `0` and `4000` respectively. This change effects both the types accepted by `ModalActionRowBuilder.__init__` and the return types of the relevant properties.
  * Removed the `emoji_id` and `emoji_name` parameters from `LinkButtonBuilder.__init__`, and `InteractiveButtonBuilder.__init__`.
  * Removed the `style` and `custom_id` parameters from `LinkButtonBuilder.__init__`.
  * Removed the `url` parameter from `InteractiveButtonBuilder.__init__`. ([#1533](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1533))
- Remove previously deprecated functionality:
  - `Intents.GUILD_BANS` (deprecated alias for `Intents.GUILD_MODERATION`)
  - `ComponentType.SELECT_MENU` (deprecated alias for `Intents.TEXT_SELECT_MENU`)
  - Not passing type through `type` argument explicitly to `MessageActionRowBuilder.add_select_menu` ([#1535](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1535))
- Renamed `StickerPack.banner_hash` to `StickerPack.banner_asset_id`. ([#1572](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1572))

### Deprecation

- Renamed `TextInputBuilder.required` property to `TextInputBuilder.is_required`. ([#1533](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1533))

- `hikari.impl.bot` moved to `hikari.impl.gateway_bot`. ([#1576](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1576))

### Features

- `Role.mention` now returns `"@everyone"` for the `@everyone` role. ([#1528](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1528))
- Refactors to the component builder interfaces which make them flatter:

  * `hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED` can now be passed to `TextInputBuilder.set_placeholder` and `TextInputBuilder.set_value`.
  * The standard implementation of a select option builder is now exposed at `hikari.impl.special_endpoints.SelectOptionBuilder`. ([#1533](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1533))
- `CommandChoice.name_localizations` field and separate `AutocompleteChoiceBuilder` for use when making autocomplete responses. ([#1539](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1539))
- Implement guild role subscriptions. ([#1550](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1550))
- Add `Role.is_guild_linked_role`. ([#1551](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1551))
- `hikari.iterators.LazyIterator.flatten` method for flattening a lazy iterator of synchronous iterables. ([#1562](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1562))
- Support sending stickers when creating a message. ([#1571](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1571))
- Added several set methods for required values to the builders:

  * `CommandBuilder.set_name`
  * `SlashCommandBuilder.set_description`
  * `InteractiveButtonBuilder.set_custom_id`
  * `SelectOptionBuilder.set_label`
  * `SelectOptionBuilder.set_value`
  * `SelectMenuBuilder.set_custom_id` ([#1574](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1574))

### Bugfixes

- `emoji=` can now be passed to `LinkButtonBuilder.__init__` and `InteractiveButtonBuilder.__init__` alone without causing serialization issues (and Pyright will now let you pass it). ([#1533](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1533))
- Open `banner.txt`s with `utf-8` encoding explicitly. ([#1545](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1545))
- Pyright will now let you pass `role_mentions` and `user_mentions` to `InteractionMessageBuilder.__init__`. ([#1560](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1560))
- Fixed forum channel applied tags not being a sequence of snowflakes. ([#1564](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1564))
- Switch to using <https://github.com/discord/twemoji> for emoji images. ([#1568](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1568))
- Fixed sticker pack handling and typing:

  * Fixed deserialization raising when `"banner_asset_id"` or `"cover_sticker_id"` weren't included in the payload.
  * `StickerPack.banner_asset_id` is now correctly typed as `Optional[Snowflake]`.
  * `StickerPack.banner_url` and `StickerPack.make_banner_url` both now correctly return `None` when `StickerPack.banner_asset_id` is `None`. ([#1572](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1572))

---


## 2.0.0.dev112 (2022-11-06)

### Breaking Changes

- Moved permission overwrite mapping and permission related methods from `GuildChannel` to `PermissibleGuildChannel`. ([#811](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/811))
- Support v10 attachments edits

  This includes breaking changes, features and things to look out for when editing messages:
  - Modifying attachments in messages that contain embeds with any image attached to them now requires the images of that embed
    image to be re-passed in the edit or they will be lost.
  - `attachment` and `attachments` in message edits now support passing an `Attachment` object to keep existing attachments.
  - `replace_attachments` has been removed, as it is now the default.
    - `attachment` and `attachments` now supports `None` to replicate the behaviour of fully removing all attachments.
  - `InteractionMessageBuilder.clear_attachments` has been implemented to remove existing attachments from messages. ([#1260](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1260))

### Features

- Thread support for REST requests and gateway events. ([#811](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/811))
- Startup and shutdown callbacks for the RESTBot interface/impl. ([#999](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/999))
- Support specifying `with_counts` and `with_expiration` in `RESTClient.fetch_invite` ([#1330](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1330))
- Support for including the `SUPPRESS_EMBEDS` flag while creating a message. ([#1331](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1331))
- Add `MANAGE_EVENTS` permission to `hikari.Permissions` ([#1334](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1334))

### Bugfixes

- Wrong typehint for `InviteGuild.features`. ([#1307](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1307))
- Fix aiohttp error "charset must not be in content type" when using `InteractionServer` ([#1320](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1320))
- The REST list methods (e.g. `fetch_channels`) no-longer raise `hikari.errors.UnrecognisedEntityError` when they encounter an unknown type. ([#1337](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1337))
- Fix deprecation warnings in CPython3.11 in `hikari.internal.ux`. ([#1344](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1344))

---

### Breaking Changes

- Lifetime improvements breaking changes:
  - `GatewayBot.join`'s `until_close` argument removed.
  - `GatewayShardImpl.get_user_id` is no longer async and will now always be available.
  - `GatewayBotAware` no longer defines the default parameters for `join`, `start` and `run`. It is left to implementation detail. ([#1204](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1204))
- Remove support for ProcessPoolExecutor executor when reading files
  - It is much more efficient to use a threadpool executor for I/O actions like this one
    - Due to the nature of process pool, we were also not able to perform proper chunking when reading off the file ([#1273](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1273))

### Deprecation

- Deprecate `CacheView.iterator` in favour of using the `itertools` module. ([#1289](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1289))

- Improve components lifetimes:
  - `GatewayBot`:
    - General speedups.
    - Fix a lot of edge cases of hard crashes if the application shuts unexpectedly.
    - More consistent signal handling.
    - `run`'s `shard_ids` argument can now be a `typing.Sequence`.
    - Improved logging.

    - Faster websocket pulling and heartbeating.
    - Improved error handling.
    - Rate limiting changes:
      - Chunking no longer has its own special ratelimit. Now it is shared with the rest of
      "non-priority" packages sent, which is of 117/60s (3 less than the hard limit).
        - "priority" packages currently only include heartbeating. ([#1204](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1204))
- Implement slash option min/max length fields ([#1216](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1216))
- Add `mention` property to `PartialChannel`. ([#1221](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1221))
- Implement new Gateway reconnect logic enforced by Discord. ([#1245](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1245))

### Bugfixes

- Lifetime improvements bugfixes:
  - `GatewayShardImpl` can now be instantiated out of an async environment for consistency with other components.
  - Correct signal handling in `RESTBot`. ([#1204](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1204))

- `dm_permission` now correctly defaults to `True` instead of `False` when parsing command objects from Discord. ([#1243](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1243))
- Fix float precision issues when creating a snowflake from a datetime object. ([#1247](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1247))
- Fix `reposition_channels` to use the correct route. ([#1259](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1259))
- Allow for `replace_attachments` kwarg to be used in `RESTClient.create_initial_response`. ([#1266](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1266))
- Ignore guild create events which contain unavailable guilds ([#1284](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1284))

---

  Add sticker related public methods onto `hikari.impl.CacheImpl` and `hikari.guilds.Guild`. ([#1126](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1126))
- `GuildVoiceChannel` now inherits from `TextableGuildChannel` instead of `GuildChannel`. ([#1189](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1189))
- Add the `app_permissions` field to command and component interactions. ([#1201](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1201))
- Add application command badge ([#1225](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1225))

### Bugfixes

- Fix how CommandBuilder handles `default_member_permissions` to match the behaviour on PartialCommand. ([#1212](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1212))

---


## 2.0.0.dev109 (2022-06-26)

### Breaking Changes

- Removal of all application commands v1 related fields and endpoints.
   - Discord has completely disabled some endpoints, so we unfortunately can't
     deprecate them instead of removing them ([#1148](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1148))
- Removed the `resolved` attribute from `AutocompleteInteraction` as autocomplete interactions never have resolved objects. ([#1152](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1152))
- `build` methods are now typed as returning `MutableMapping[str, typing.Any]`. ([#1164](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1164))

### Deprecation

- Support for attachments in REST-based interaction responses. ([#1048](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1048))
- Add option to disable automatic member chunking.
  Added the `auto_chunk_members` kwarg to `GatewayBot` and `EventManagerImpl`, which when `False` will disable automatic member chunking. ([#1084](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1084))
- Allow passing multiple event types to the listen decorator.
  Parse union type hints for events if listen decorator is empty. ([#1103](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1103))
- Animated guild banner support. ([#1116](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1116))

---


## 2.0.0.dev108 (2022-03-27)

### Breaking Changes

- `hikari.config` has now been split up to `hikari.api.config` and `hikari.impl.config` to avoid leaking impl detail.
  This also means that config types are no-longer accessible at the top level (directly on `hikari`). ([#1067](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1067))
- Hide the entity factory's component deserialize methods. ([#1074](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1074))
- Remove nonce parameter from create message.
  This was purposely removed from the bot api documentation inferring that its no-longer officially supported. ([#1075](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1075))
- Remove `VoiceRegion.is_vip` due to Discord no longer sending it. ([#1086](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1086))

- Optimize event dispatching by only deserializing events when they are needed. ([#1094](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1094))
- Add `hikari.locales.Locale` to help with Discord locale strings. ([#1090](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1090))

### Bugfixes

- `fetch_my_guilds` no-longer returns duplicate guilds nor makes unnecessary (duplicated) requests when `newest_first` is set to `True`. ([#1059](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1059))
- Add `InviteEvent` to `hikari.events.channel_events.__all__`, `hikari.events.__all__` and `hikari.__all__`. ([#1065](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1065))

---


## 2.0.0.dev107 (2022-03-04)

### Features

- Added a `total_length` function to `hikari.embeds.Embed`
  - Takes into account the character length of the embed's title, description, fields (all field names and values), footer, and author combined.
  - Useful for determining if the embed exceeds Discord's 6000 character limit. ([#796](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/796))
- Added attachment command option type support. ([#1015](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1015))
- Add MESSAGE_CONTENT intent. ([#1021](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1021))
- Custom substitutions can now be used in `hikari.internal.ux.print_banner`. ([#1022](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1022))
- `get_guild()` is now available on `hikari.Member`. ([#1025](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1025))
- The notorious "failed to communicate with server" log message is now a warning rather than an error. ([#1041](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1041))
- `hikari.applications`, `hikari.files`, `hikari.snowflakes` and `hikari.undefined` are now all explicitly exported by `hikari.__init__`, allowing pyright to see them without a direct import. ([#1042](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1042))

### Bugfixes

- Fix bucket lock not being released on errors while being acquired, which locked the bucket infinitely ([#841](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/841))
- `enable_signal_handlers` now only defaults to `True` when the run/start method is called in the main thread.
  This avoids these functions from always raising when being run in a threaded environment as only the main thread can register signal handlers. ([#998](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/998))
- Sub-command options are now properly deserialized in the autocomplete flow to `AutocompleteInteractionOption` instead of `CommandInteractionOption`. ([#1012](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1012))
- Attempt to reconnect on a gateway `TimeoutError`. ([#1014](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1014))
- Properly close `GatewayBot` when not fully started. ([#1023](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1023))
- The async context manager returned by `File.stream` now errors on enter if the target file doesn't exist to improve error handling when a file that doesn't exist is sent as an attachment.

  The multiprocessing file reader strategy now expands user relative (`~`) links (like the threaded strategy). ([#1046](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/1046))

---


## 2.0.0.dev106 (2022-02-03)

### Breaking Changes

- Running the standard interaction server implementation now requires a `hikari[server]` install.

  This matches a switch over to PyNacl for the cryptographic payload validation. ([#986](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/986))

### Deprecation

- Deprecated `RESTClient.command_builder` and `RESTClient.create_application_command`.

- Add `display_avatar_url` property to `hikari.Member` and `hikari.User`. ([#975](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/975))
- old_x keyword arguments in the event factory now default to `None`. ([#984](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/984))
- Strip tokens in the standard bot impls and RESTApp.

  This helps avoids a common mistake with trailing new-lines which leads to confusing errors on request. ([#989](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/989))

### Bugfixes

- Relaxed typing of methods with union entry specific specialisations through overloads. ([#876](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/876))
- Fix deprecation warnings raised by usage of `asyncio.gather` outside of an active event loop in `GatewayBot.run`. ([#954](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/954))
- UTF-8 characters are now properly handled for audit-log reasons in REST requests. ([#963](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/963))

  - Some `guild_create`-ish methods were renamed to `guild_available` ([#809](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/809))
- Remove `hikari.errors.RESTErrorCode` enum
  - The message that is sent with the error code is the info that the enum contained ([#816](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/816))
- PermissionOverwrite doesn't inherit from Unique anymore and isn't hashable. Equality checks now consider all its fields. ([#820](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/820))

### Features
