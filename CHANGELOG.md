Hikari 2.0.0.dev103 (2021-10-06)
================================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- `USE_PUBLIC_THREADS` and `USE_PRIVATE_THREADS` permissions have been removed in favour of new threads permission
  - New permissions are split into `CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS`, `CREATE_PRIVATE_THREADS` and `SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREADS` ([#799](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/799))
- `GuildAvailableEvent` will no longer fire when the bot joins new guilds
  - Some `guild_create`-ish methods were renamed to `guild_available` ([#809](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/809))
- Remove `hikari.errors.RESTErrorCode` enum
  - The message that is sent with the error code is the info that the enum contained ([#816](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/816))
- PermissionOverwrite doesn't inherit from Unique anymore and isn't hashable. Equality checks now consider all its fields. ([#820](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/820))


Features
--------

- Add new `START_EMBEDDED_ACTIVITIES` permission ([#798](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/798))
- Support new `channel_types` field in `CommandOption` ([#800](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/800))
- Add the `add_component` method to `hikari.api.special_endpoints.ActionRowBuilder` ([#804](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/804))
- Add `old_guild` attribute to `GuildLeaveEvent`. ([#806](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/806))
- Add `GuildJoinEvent` that will fire when the bot joins new guilds ([#809](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/809))


Bugfixes
--------

- Fix re-uploading forms with resources ([#787](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/787))
- Prevent double linking embed resources, which causes them to upload twice
  - This was caused by attempting to move the resource from one embed to another ([#788](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/788))
- Fix `BulkDeleteError` returning incorrect values for `messages_skipped`
  - This affected the `__str__` and `percentage_completion`, which also returned incorrect values ([#817](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/817))


Documentation Improvements
--------------------------

- Add docstrings to the remaining undocumented `GatewayBot` methods ([#804](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/804))

- New `is_for_emoji` methods to relevant reaction events ([#770](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/issues/770))
